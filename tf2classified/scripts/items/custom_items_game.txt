[LAST UPDATED: 2/17/2026, TF2C v3.0.3]

Hi! It's Kiri again. Miss me~?

Anyway, here's an updated list of ALL working attributes / weapon stats in TF2 Classified! Yes, all of them. This also encompasses all attributes from Live TF2 that were grandfathered in, at least the one's I'm aware of.
I've included quite a lot of notes and documentation on stat behavior and anything you should be aware of, as well as some comments on several unlisted attributes, so Ctrl + F your way around to see what you need!
If you want to transfer this document to another medium, like a website, wiki page, or organized table, feel free! I'd appreciate a shout-out, but it's not necessary. Happy weaponsmithing!

Other notes:
-TF2 Classified can be fidgety with attributes working depending on if you put it in "static_attrs" or "attributes" in your item_schema. If it doesn't work immediately for you, try using the other one. It's weird.
-This list is probably incomplete, especially with undocumented attributes. If you manage to discover another new one that's not present and that works in the latest version, let me know!
-Lastly, if you find a weird issue or are being bothered by how one of these attributes works, don't hesitate to post on the TF2 Classified issue tracker. It's a decent way of flagging the devs' attention.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------
//--WORKING ATTRIBUTES - Attributes below generally work as intended--
//--------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - "damage penalty" (mult_dmg)
2 - "damage bonus" (mult_dmg)
3 - "clip size penalty" (mult_clipsize)
4 - "clip size bonus" (mult_clipsize)
5 - "fire rate penalty" (mult_postfiredelay)								- Note for returning modders: this inherits Live behavior for TF_Weapon_Minigun, so it automatically pitches your weapon up or down based on firerate. Super annoying.
6 - "fire rate bonus" (mult_postfiredelay)
7 - "heal rate penalty" (mult_medigun_healrate)
8 - "heal rate bonus" (mult_medigun_healrate)								- Only affects Mediguns & 'Naders, as you'd expect, but not the Shock Therapy heal.
9 - "ubercharge rate penalty" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate)					- Can be used with negatives to decrease übercharge, if you're a sadist. No effect on "add_onhit_ubercharge".
10 - "ubercharge rate bonus" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate)
11 - "overheal bonus" (mult_medigun_overheal_amount)						- This has a lower bound of 0 (can't start overhealing at all), and an upper bound of 1 (the normal amount). Attempting to set it higher doesn't work!
12 - "overheal decay penalty" (mult_medigun_overheal_decay)					- This has... strange behavior? The intended range seems to be from 0.01 - 1, where lower values are a faster overheal drain rate, and higher than that is slower. 0 is completely stopped overheal drain, though.
13 - "overheal decay bonus" (mult_medigun_overheal_decay)
14 - "overheal decay disabled" (mult_medigun_overheal_decay)
15 - "crit mod disabled" (mult_crit_chance)									- This is actually a general-purpose critrate mult - if you set it to anything above 0, it actually does work!
16 - "heal on hit for rapidfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
17 - "add uber charge on hit" (add_onhit_ubercharge)
18 - "medigun charge is crit boost" (set_charge_type)
20 - "crit vs burning players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)						- Apparently, this accepts way more than just Burning, it just happens that Burning is the first, as "1". This is a bitflag-controlled attrib, and there's more I'll discuss in a later section.
21 - "dmg penalty vs nonburning" (mult_dmg_vs_nonburning)
22 - "no crit vs nonburning" (set_nocrit_vs_nonburning)						- Interestingly, this doesn't stop crits from happening. Random crits will just do normal melee damage, and guaranteed crits completely ignore this and do full damage. Weird.
24 - "mod flamethrower back crit" (set_flamethrower_back_crit)				- As it says, only for TF_Weapon_Flamethrower. No dice for TF_Weapon_RocketLauncher_Fireball.
25 - "hidden secondary max ammo penalty" (mult_maxammo_secondary)
26 - "max health additive bonus" (add_maxhealth)
28 - "crit mod disabled hidden" (mult_crit_chance)							- First of many. These are generally identical to their parent attributes, but the text doesn't show up.
30 - "fists have radial buff" (set_weapon_mode)								- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Fists. EXTREMELY jank. On getting a kill on a melee that does the KGB taunt, you & nearby teammates will get +50 HP back and a 10% boost to critrate! You're unable to do a normal taunt by regular means with this.
31 - "critboost on kill" (add_onkill_critboost_time)
32 - "slow enemy on hit" (mult_onhit_enemyspeed)							- Input is percentage chance to slow an enemy on hit... that seems backwards. No modifiers for duration or potency of the slow, just chance to inflict. Fucked uP. Preferably, just use "add_onhit_addcond" and apply a slow effect for a certain time if you want to modify that.
33 - "set cloak is feign death" (set_weapon_mode)							- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Invis. It seems as if they hard-coded all of the newer changes into this one weapon-mode... Feign death, + speed, + dmg res. Yikes.
34 - "mult cloak meter consume rate" (mult_cloak_meter_consume_rate)
35 - "mult cloak meter regen rate" (mult_cloak_meter_regen_rate)
36 - "spread penalty" (mult_spread_scale)									- This can be added to weapons with no base spread if you make a new attribute, that flat-adds spread using additive numbers. Splicing (from old TF2C) would work, but Live doesn't appear to support it anymore.
37 - "hidden primary max ammo bonus" (mult_maxammo_primary)
38 - "mod bat launches balls" (set_weapon_mode)								- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Bat_Wood & TF_Weapon_Bat_Giftwrap. Launch a projectile on alt-fire. Most properties - gameplay and visual - of both the default baseball and ornament seem to be hardcoded to the projectiles.
41 - "sniper charge per sec" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec)
42 - "sniper no headshots" (set_weapon_mode)								- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_SniperRifle, and just that so far as I can tell. Used to be paired with "no_headshot" in Legacy TF2C, but that's currently missing.
43 - "scattergun no reload single" (set_scattergun_no_reload_single)		- This behaves a bit strangely. It works, but if it's on a weapon that usually reloads multiple shells, it'll reload the entire clip in the time it takes for ONE shell reload.
44 - "scattergun has knockback" (set_scattergun_has_knockback)				- Knockback on enemies! If it's a TF_Weapon_Scattergun, you also do fixed knockback to yourself, like the FaN. Otherwise (INCLUDING for other Scattergun variants), it's just enemy knockback. Only seems to work on hitscan and melee.
45 - "bullets per shot bonus" (mult_bullets_per_shot)						- Doesn't work on projectiles...
46 - "sniper zoom penalty" (mult_zoom_fov)									- Works as expected! However, even works with really high FOV values (which pull your view backwards), and even negative values (just imagine it). Generally, the default FoV for just standing around is 90, if you want an imperceptible scope-in!
48 - "set cloak is movement based" (set_weapon_mode)						- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Invis.
49 - "no double jump" (set_scout_doublejump_disabled)						- Completely disables Scout's extra jumping abilities, even if other weapons give him more jumps to work with like the Atomizer or (new) Soda Popper.
51 - "revolver use hit locations" (set_weapon_mode)							- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Revolver. Allows headshots, and has a built-in "cooldown" + max range mechanic with your crosshair. Can supplant this with "can_headshot" attributes on other weapons for a more general-purpose headshot ability.
52 - "backstab shield" (set_blockbackstab_once)								- Works as intended - and then some! On TF_Wearable_Razorback (maybe the others too, unsure), this comes with a recharge meter that recharges when all of your backstab-blocks are depleted. On other weapons, though, this is basically indefinite backstab block with a stun to the Spy - use carefully.
53 - "fire retardant" (set_fire_retardant)									- TO AN EXTENT you also can do this by setting "mult_dmgtaken_from_fire" to 0?
54 - "move speed penalty" (mult_player_movespeed)
[TEXT] 56 - "jarate description" (desc_jarate_description)					- Text-only: "Coated enemies take mini-crits / Can be used to extinguish fires"
57 - "health regen" (add_health_regen)
58 - "self dmg push force increased" (mult_dmgself_push_force)
59 - "self dmg push force decreased" (mult_dmgself_push_force)
60 - "dmg taken from fire reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire)
61 - "dmg taken from fire increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire)
62 - "dmg taken from crit reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_crit)
63 - "dmg taken from crit increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_crit)
64 - "dmg taken from blast reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions)
65 - "dmg taken from blast increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions)
66 - "dmg taken from bullets reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
67 - "dmg taken from bullets increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
68 - "increase player capture value" (add_player_capturevalue)				- Works how you expect, also works with negatives (you won't be able to contribute to capture progress at all). Works correctly on multiclass - though it's not a good idea if you have this on Scout + Civ too unless you're reducing cap power!
69 - "health from healers reduced" (mult_health_fromhealers)
70 - "health from healers increased" (mult_health_fromhealers)
71 - "weapon burn dmg increased" (mult_wpn_burndmg)							- This stuff refers to afterburn, not regular flamethrower burning.
72 - "weapon burn dmg reduced" (mult_wpn_burndmg)
73 - "weapon burn time increased" (mult_wpn_burntime)						- This is on WEARER, so unless prevented, this stacks with other weapons that also have this!!
74 - "weapon burn time reduced" (mult_wpn_burntime)
75 - "aiming movespeed increased" (mult_player_aiming_movespeed)			- Modified speed while aiming. Revved Miniguns and Scoped Rifles count as "aiming". Lower bound is immobile (obviously), but upper bound can be FASTER than your default move speed!
76 - "maxammo primary increased" (mult_maxammo_primary)
77 - "maxammo primary reduced" (mult_maxammo_primary)
78 - "maxammo secondary increased" (mult_maxammo_secondary)
79 - "maxammo secondary reduced" (mult_maxammo_secondary)
80 - "maxammo metal increased" (mult_maxammo_metal)							- Also works for non-Engineer classes (every other class carries 100 metal by default, originally for weapon drop pickups).
81 - "maxammo metal reduced" (mult_maxammo_metal)
82 - "cloak consume rate increased" (mult_cloak_meter_consume_rate)
83 - "cloak consume rate decreased" (mult_cloak_meter_consume_rate)
84 - "cloak regen rate increased" (mult_cloak_meter_regen_rate)
85 - "cloak regen rate decreased" (mult_cloak_meter_regen_rate)
86 - "minigun spinup time increased" (mult_minigun_spinup_time)
87 - "minigun spinup time decreased" (mult_minigun_spinup_time)
88 - "max pipebombs increased" (add_max_pipebombs)
89 - "max pipebombs decreased" (add_max_pipebombs)
90 - "SRifle Charge rate increased" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec)
91 - "SRifle Charge rate decreased" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec)
92 - "Construction rate increased" (mult_construction_value)
93 - "Construction rate decreased" (mult_construction_value)
94 - "Repair rate increased" (mult_repair_value)
95 - "Repair rate decreased" (mult_repair_value)
96 - "Reload time increased" (mult_reload_time)
97 - "Reload time decreased" (mult_reload_time)
98 - "selfdmg on hit for rapidfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
99 - "Blast radius increased" (mult_explosion_radius)

100 - "Blast radius decreased" (mult_explosion_radius)
101 - "Projectile range increased" (mult_projectile_range)					- A modifier for hitscan range! Input is a multiplier for the default hitscan range, which is usually 4096 hU's.
102 - "Projectile range decreased" (mult_projectile_range)
103 - "Projectile speed increased" (mult_projectile_speed)
104 - "Projectile speed decreased" (mult_projectile_speed)
105 - "overheal penalty" (mult_medigun_overheal_amount)
106 - "weapon spread bonus" (mult_spread_scale)
107 - "move speed bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
108 - "health from packs increased" (mult_health_frompacks)
109 - "health from packs decreased" (mult_health_frompacks)
110 - "heal on hit for slowfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
111 - "selfdmg on hit for slowfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
112 - "ammo regen" (addperc_ammo_regen)										- Passively regenerate an input-percentage of your ammo across all weapons every 5s! Very, very strong, so set this to a very low value, like 0.01!
113 - "metal regen" (add_metal_regen)										- Regen an input amount of metal every 5s. It's just a flat number, so keep this fairly low, like between 5-15.
114 - "mod mini-crit airborne" (mini_crit_airborne)							- Only activates for blast knockbacks / jump pads!
115 - "mod shovel damage boost" (set_weapon_mode)							- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Shovel. As your health lowers, do stuff - 1 for a damage-boost, and 2 for a speed-boost. There doesn't seem to be any option to have both at once.
116 - "mod soldier buff type" (set_buff_type)								- For certain items that have a meter that gives a buff, switches what it is! 1, 2, and 3 are banner minicrits, resistance, and health-gain. 4 enables the parachute model for base jumper. 5 is phlog crits, 6 is heatmaker focus. Banners can't use anything after 3. Full table below.
117 - "dmg falloff increased" (mult_dmg_falloff)
118 - "dmg falloff decreased" (mult_dmg_falloff)
[NEED_FEATURES] 119 - "sticky detonate mode" (set_detonate_mode)			- Some unique toggles for Detonation on certain Demoman projectiles. 1 makes stickybombs explode under your cursor (Only for TF_Weapon_PipebombLauncher), and 2 is LnL's shattering bombs. Legacy TF2C used to have another mode, 3, with bombs that explode immediately on hit world.
120 - "sticky arm time penalty" (sticky_arm_time)
121 - "stickies detonate stickies" (stickies_detonate_stickies)
122 - "mod demo buff type" (set_buff_type)
123 - "speed boost when active" (mult_move_speed_when_active)
[NEED_ASSETS] 124 - "mod wrench builds minisentry" (wrench_builds_minisentry)	- Turns your sentry into a mini-sentry, duh! Has a few quirks - the mini-sentry itself is somewhat missing assets, and Engineer will use the Gunslinger viewmodel-arms by default. You can re-overwrite them with custom_hand_viewmodel to set a different arms model.
125 - "max health additive penalty" (add_maxhealth)
126 - "sticky arm time bonus" (sticky_arm_time)
127 - "sticky air burst mode" (set_detonate_mode)
128 - "provide on active" (provide_on_active)								- Bread-and-butter meta-attribute for restricting stats to only apply while the weapon is out! Obviously is an all-or-nothing deal, even helpful wearer-effects get restricted, so be aware!
129 - "health drain" (add_health_regen)
130 - "medic regen bonus" (medic_regen)
131 - "medic regen penalty" (medic_regen)
[TEXT] 133 - "soldier model index" (desc_soldiermedal_index)				- Text-only: "Medal no. ---"
134 - "attach particle effect" (set_attached_particle)						- The first of various particle-related attributes. Spawns a varied particle according to a lookup table. You can find valid particles under "attribute_controlled_attached_particles" in the item schema. For WEAPONS, the only one that's visible by default is "4" - the community sparkle!!
135 - "rocket jump damage reduction" (rocket_jump_dmg_reduction)			- Contrary to the name, this applies to any kind of blast jump!
136 - "mod sentry killed revenge" (sentry_killed_revenge)					- In conjunction with TF_Weapon_Shotgun_Revenge, setting this to 1 will provide guaranteed crits based on the amount of kill(-assists) your Sentry got before destruction. Higher or lower values don't do anything.
137 - "dmg bonus vs buildings" (mult_dmg_vs_buildings)
138 - "dmg penalty vs players" (mult_dmg_vs_players)
139 - "lunchbox adds maxhealth bonus" (set_weapon_mode)						- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Lunchbox.
140 - "hidden maxhealth non buffed" (add_maxhealth_nonbuffed)
[TEXT] 143 - "custom employee number" (set_employee_number)					- Text-only: "Hire Date: ---" - This is the first of many peculiar "set-date" attributes that describe moments in time. Input value is a "Unix Timestamp", which you should look up a converter for!
144 - "lunchbox adds minicrits" (set_weapon_mode)							- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Lunchbox. Adds minicrits on consumption, and forces you to melee-only! Seems also to be used as a generic "weapon mode" attribute, since this specific stat is used by MANY weapons for their mode-switching.
145 - "taunt is highfive" (enable_misc2_highfive)							- This appears to be either identical to, or an early version of "enable_misc2_holdtaunt", it seems to do the same thing?
146 - "damage applies to sappers" (set_dmg_apply_to_sapper)				 	- Perhaps to be expected, but this only applies to melee damage.
[TEXT] 147 - "Wrench index" (desc_wrench_index)								- Text-only: "Wrench no. ---"
148 - "building cost reduction" (building_cost_reduction)					- Technically uncapped, but the costs can go over your current max metal capacity.
149 - "bleeding duration" (bleeding_duration)
150 - "turn to gold" (set_turn_to_gold)										- Works on most weapons that can get direct kills! Plays a sound and turns the ragdoll into a gold-colored floppy statue.
154 - "disguise on backstab" (set_disguise_on_backstab)
155 - "cannot disguise" (set_cannot_disguise)								- This includes trying to use any of your disguise commands to try to do it directly, it has no effect. It'll also take away your disguise if you were already disguised when you recieved this weapon.
156 - "silent killer" (set_silent_killer)									- This is actually general-purpose, and as the name implies, it silences any death scream or shout your enemy would have otherwise emitted. Works on any kind of kill on most weapons.
158 - "add cloak on kill" (add_cloak_on_kill)
161 - "flame size penalty" (mult_flame_size)								- These four "technically" do something, but they're ALL very buggy, so I don't recommend doing anything with them. Just here for completion since they have "an effect".
162 - "flame size bonus" (mult_flame_size)
163 - "flame life penalty" (mult_flame_life)
164 - "flame life bonus" (mult_flame_life)
165 - "charged airblast" (set_charged_airblast)								- Supposedly, this is supposed to charge your airblast, and it DOES change its behavior, but really it just adds a pause while you hold down M2, and the airblast has no difference in strength with or without charge. Maybe it's meant to reduce airblast spam?
166 - "add cloak on hit" (add_cloak_on_hit)
167 - "disguise damage reduction" (disguise_damage_reduction)
168 - "disguise no burn" (disguise_no_burn)
170 - "airblast cost increased" (mult_airblast_cost)
171 - "airblast cost decreased" (mult_airblast_cost)
173 - "flame ammopersec increased" (mult_flame_ammopersec)					- Modifies ammo consumption rate of a Flamethrower. Doesn't change how much damage you do, though. It's like a fuel leak.
174 - "flame ammopersec decreased" (mult_flame_ammopersec)
175 - "jarate duration" (jarate_duration)									- For TF_Weapon_SniperRifle (and variants, not TF2C_Weapon_Hunting_Revolver though) - inflict a variable duration of jarate-sodden onto enemies on a scoped hit. For TF_Weapon_SniperRifle_Classic, this doesn't need to be a scoped hit and works essentially unconditionally!
177 - "deploy time increased" (mult_deploy_time)							- Modifies weapon-switch speed, ALL weapons switch faster or slower globally.
178 - "deploy time decreased" (mult_deploy_time)
179 - "minicrits become crits" (minicrits_become_crits)
180 - "heal on kill" (heal_on_kill)											- NOTE, this'll also apply if you get a delayed kill, like with a DoT effect, or from a projectile. You won't get any health back from another weapon's kill while this one's active, though!
181 - "no self blast dmg" (no_self_blast_dmg)								- For rockets and pipe-bombs & related, setting this to "2" will do all sorts of Jumper stuff - you won't take damage from your explosives, you make a whistling noise when blast jumping, and it tries to spawn appropriate jumper-related particle effects per projectile. Higher values remove the self-blast dmg resistance, but the other effects stay.
182 - "slow enemy on hit major" (mult_onhit_enemyspeed_major)
183 - "aiming movespeed decreased" (mult_player_aiming_movespeed)
[TEXT] 187 - "set supply crate series" (supply_crate_series)				- Text-only: "Crate series #---". Can't see how this text would be helpful unless you were making a crate that doubles as a weapon or something. Jot that down!
190 - "active health regen" (active_item_health_regen)
191 - "active health degen" (active_item_health_regen)
[TEXT] 197 - "halloween item" (halloween_item)								- Text-only: "This is a special Halloween --- item"
199 - "switch from wep deploy time decreased" (mult_switch_from_wep_deploy_time)	- Note: This USED to be "fires healing bolts", a text-only display for Crusader's Crossbow's healing bolts. Documented below.

200 - "enables aoe heal" (enables_aoe_heal)									- For any weapon Medic uses, add the Amputator heal-AoE effect while taunting! Doesn't work off-class, even with Medic weapons.
201 - "gesture speed increase" (mult_gesture_time)							- This might mess with the audio timing for sfx during taunts, but otherwise works as intended, speed up or slow down a taunt animation! Higher values for faster taunts.
202 - "charge time increased" (mod_charge_time)								- No text, but modifies Übercharge time.
203 - "drop health pack on kill" (drop_health_pack_on_kill)					- On-wearer, so dropped healthkits are for any weapon of yours that does damage, unless you specifically prevent it.
204 - "hit self on miss" (hit_self_on_miss)									- Hit yourself, idiot. When you swing and completely miss with a Melee weapon, inflict half of the base damage and some knockback to yourself! Not affected by crits, though you'll hear the crit-taken sound on hit. For TF_Weapon_Slap, you'll also hit yourself twice in a row.
205 - "dmg from ranged reduced" (dmg_from_ranged)							- These are generic ranged and melee, but there also exist attribs that let you have more specific bullet + flame res and melee vulns.
206 - "dmg from melee increased" (dmg_from_melee)
207 - "blast dmg to self increased" (blast_dmg_to_self)
208 - "Set DamageType Ignite" (set_dmgtype_ignite)
209 - "minicrit vs burning player" (or_minicrit_vs_playercond_burning)
215 - "apply z velocity on damage" (apply_z_velocity_on_damage)				- When you hit an enemy, apply a variable velocity in Hu/S to them in the Up-Down direction! Positive values send upward, negative values send downward.
216 - "apply look velocity on damage" (apply_look_velocity_on_damage)		- As above, when you hit an enemy, apply velocity in the direction you're facing, backwards or forwards. ALSO NOTE: Neither of these two attribs have falloff! Use wisely!
217 - "sanguisuge" (sanguisuge)												- Kunai's backstab lifesteal. When getting a backstab, instantly get your target's health back in HP that can overheal.
218 - "mark for death" (mark_for_death)										- Set one target at a time to be MfD. If you want / need multiple at a time, try using "add_onhit_addcond" set to any one of the MfD conditions!
219 - "decapitate type" (decapitate_type)									- Changes weapon mode for the TF_Weapon_Claymore! For weapons that can force players to do the headshot animation, decapitate 'em! This currently includes TF_Weapon_Claymore, TF_Weapon_Katana, TF_Weapon_SniperRifle, & TF2C_Weapon_Hunting_Revolver, but the Bow or any other thing that can headshot can't seem to do it...
220 - "restore health on kill" (restore_health_on_kill)						- On getting a kill, restore a fixed percentage of your current maxhealth as health! Overengineered? Maybe... Could be supplemented by something easier? Maybe!
221 - "mult decloak rate" (mult_decloak_rate)								- No text, but modifies how long it takes for you to become visible after decloaking.
222 - "mult sniper charge after bodyshot" (mult_sniper_charge_after_bodyshot)
223 - "mult sniper charge after miss" (mult_sniper_charge_after_miss)
224 - "dmg bonus while half dead" (mult_dmg_bonus_while_half_dead)			- From the Shahanshah. You could probably combine this with the Escape Plan's weapon-mode to get a facsimile of the original Equalizer.
225 - "dmg penalty while half alive" (mult_dmg_penalty_while_half_alive)
226 - "honorbound" (honorbound)												- Switching off from a weapon with this will deduct 50 hp (fixed) unless you got a kill with it! Better hope your weapon's capable of getting kills, or you have more than 50 hp to spare! ALSO, on TF_Weapon_Katana, this stat will allow you to 1hko other players also using a TF_Weapon_Katana (even if it's a different item!).
[NEED_FEATURES] 231 - "medigun charge is megaheal" (set_charge_type)		- A modifier for what Übercharge Medic's Secondaries use. 1 is critboost, 2 is megaheal, and 3-5 are vacc. resists! Legacy TF2C had another one for 2, which was "push buff" - it added minicrits + def. buff. Medic also sometimes gets unique effects from "set_weapon_mode" on Mediguns, as well.
233 - "mod medic healed damage bonus" (medic_healed_damage_bonus)
234 - "mod medic healed deploy time penalty" (mod_medic_healed_deploy_time)	- A very strange attribute. When you aren't being healed by a Medic, your weapon deploy speed is faster or slower.
235 - "mod shovel speed boost" (set_weapon_mode)
236 - "mod weapon blocks healing" (weapon_blocks_healing)					- Disables recieved healing while the weapon's active. This applies to most of the usual sources; Medics, Dispensers, Health Kits, the like.
237 - "mult sniper charge after headshot" (mult_sniper_charge_after_headshot)
238 - "minigun no spin sounds" (minigun_no_spin_sounds)						- Changes the behavior of any TF_Weapon_Minigun (or similar's) rev idle and wind down noises! It won't play an idle noise at all, and the wind down noise plays immediately after you stop firing the weapon. You can substitute this by just setting the sounds manually to silence, if necessary.
239 - "ubercharge rate bonus for healer" (mult_uberchargerate_for_healer)
240 - "reload time decreased while healed" (mult_reload_time_while_healed)
241 - "reload time increased hidden" (mult_reload_time_hidden)
243 - "mod rage on hit penalty" (rage_on_hit)
244 - "mod rage on hit bonus" (rage_on_hit)
245 - "mod rage damage boost" (rage_damage)									- I'm not entirely sure if this works. It's supposed to increase damage dealt the higher your meter is, but most rage-meter-based items I've tested don't seem to get any change.
246 - "mult charge turn control" (charge_turn_control)
247 - "no charge impact range" (no_charge_impact_range)
248 - "charge impact damage increased" (charge_impact_damage)
249 - "charge recharge rate increased" (charge_recharge_rate)
250 - "air dash count" (air_dash_count)										- For Scout only, adds a variable amount of extra jumps you can do! (It also tries to play an annoying sound, but it's broken, mercifully!) Can be used to remove the double-jump as well. Can also enable dealing minicrits while airborne for any Scout-held weapons with this attribute! Input is actually surprisingly complex, and half-values modify whether or not you deal mini-crits while airborne. Table below.
251 - "speed buff ally" (speed_buff_ally)									- Hitting an ally with any melee will give both of you a speed-boost! Seems to be a static 3s or so, no matter what.
252 - "damage force reduction" (damage_force_reduction)
253 - "mult cloak rate" (mult_cloak_rate)
255 - "airblast pushback scale" (airblast_pushback_scale)
256 - "mult airblast refire time" (mult_airblast_refire_time)				- Resembles that glitch you can do on the Commentary Maps at low values. Also drains your ammo at lightning speed unless you lower the consumption.
257 - "airblast vertical pushback scale" (airblast_vertical_pushback_scale)
259 - "boots falling stomp" (boots_falling_stomp)
260 - "deflection size multiplier" (deflection_size_multiplier)				- No text, but this increases or decreases your Airblast's effective range.
263 - "melee bounds multiplier" (melee_bounds_multiplier)					- These two are used to increase your melee range. They always appear together, so hard to say what they do individually.
264 - "melee range multiplier" (melee_range_multiplier)
266 - "projectile penetration" (projectile_penetration)						- For hitscan weapons, lets your bullets continue and penetrate a variable amount of additional other players / targets after hitting the first! Doesn't appear to have any effect on projectiles like arrows.
267 - "mod crit while airborne" (crit_while_airborne)						- If you're blast jumping or jumppad-launched, you'll do crits while in the air! For Blast Jumps, I feel like it only works on Soldier + Demoman...?
269 - "mod see enemy health" (see_enemy_health)								- For Medic, lets you see enemy names (and status) via a hud popup, similar to Spy. On most every other class, the hud popup only displays a skull, and no name or status info. Probably a bug!
[MvM] 270 - "powerup max charges" (powerup_max_charges)						- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. These 5 are relevant to tf_powerup_bottle, which DOES exist now, but may be awkward to actually use given it's gamemode-restricted.
[MvM] 271 - "powerup charges" (powerup_charges)
[MvM] 272 - "powerup duration" (powerup_duration)
[MvM] 273 - "critboost" (critboost)
[MvM] 274 - "ubercharge" (ubercharge)
275 - "cancel falling damage" (cancel_falling_damage)						- Can also maybe do "mult_dmgtaken_from_fall" set to 0...
276 - "bidirectional teleport" (bidirectional_teleport)
[MvM] 277 - "multiple sentries" (multiple_sentries)							- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode.
278 - "effect bar recharge rate increased" (effectbar_recharge_rate)
279 - "maxammo grenades1 increased" (mult_maxammo_grenades1)				- Certain unconventional weapons use "Grenades1" as an ammo type - such as the MIRV and the Shock Therapy.
[NEED_FEATURES] 280 - "override projectile type" (override_projectile_type)	- Change your projectiles to something else! Works for most conventional projectiles, as well as to-and-from bullets. I listed ones I know of in the BitFlag specifics section! Behavior is, in general, a lot less flexible than Legacy TF2C, plan ahead.
[TEXT] 281 - "energy weapon no ammo" (energy_weapon_no_ammo)				- This seems to be display-only, and doesn't do anything. In Legacy TF2C, this is a general-purpose infinite-ammo stat that prevents you from depleting ammo when reloading.
[TEXT] 282 - "energy weapon charged shot" (energy_weapon_charged_shot)		- I don't believe these 4 attributes even do anything; most of the properties for the DRG weapons seem hardcoded to their projectiles. Shit.
[TEXT] 283 - "energy weapon penetration" (energy_weapon_penetration)		- This ONLY appears to work for the R. Bison / TF_Weapon_Raygun's projectile?
[TEXT] 284 - "energy weapon no hurt building" (energy_weapon_no_hurt_building)	- This is display-only text for the DRG buildings' 80% damage penalty to buildings. Just use something like "mult_dmg_vs_buildings" for this!
[TEXT] 285 - "energy weapon no deflect" (energy_weapon_no_deflect)			- Text-only: "Projectile cannot be deflected"
286 - "engy building health bonus" (mult_engy_building_health)				- Note: These two stay when switching loadouts on Engineer, so be mindful if a something gives more or less health to buildings, it'll stick around like that until destruction!
287 - "engy sentry damage bonus" (mult_engy_sentry_damage)
288 - "no crit boost" (no_crit_boost)										- This nullifies the crit-particles & sounds, but a crit-boosted attack will still do crit-damage. Yes, this also applies to the Cow Mangler.
289 - "centerfire projectile" (centerfire_projectile)						- Works for everything I've tested it with, not just rockets - forces the projectile to ALWAYS fire from the center! Maybe a little moot, now that "tf2c_centerfire_preference" exists...
[NEED_ASSETS] 295 - "has pipboy build interface" (set_custom_buildmenu)		- Seems to only affect the Destruction build-menu...? It's also missing assets / UI elements for new buildings, like the Jump Pad.
296 - "sapper kills collect crits" (sapper_kills_collect_crits)				- This works, but is EXTREMELY BROKEN if not put specifically on a TF_Weapon_Revolver. Gained crits (from sapping or backstabs) will otherwise very easily leak and very easily persist until death. Somehow, the Diamondback found a way to get even worse...
297 - "sniper only fire zoomed" (sniper_only_fire_zoomed)					- Only works on TF_Weapon_SniperRifle; emit particles on trying to shoot non-scoped. Also plays "sound_special2", which you can set to anything you like.
298 - "mod ammo per shot" (mod_ammo_per_shot)								- Changes your "ammo efficiency" - how much each shot decrements your ammo counter. -1 in conjunction with "mod max primary clip override" allows for a functionally infinite clip (with no reloading to boot).
299 - "add onhit addammo" (add_onhit_addammo)								- Specifically, this is Widowmaker's ammo-on-hit mechanic - when hitting an enemy, adds back a variable amount of ammo into your clip based on how much damage you dealt to them. You can still lose ammo even if landing a shot if it didn't do much damage! You can use higher variables to increase the threshold at which you get ammo back for your damage.

[TEXT] 300 - "electrical airblast DISPLAY ONLY" (electrical_airblast_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- Text-only: "Alt-Fire: Launches a projectile-consuming energy ball. Costs 65 metal."
[NEED_FIXES] 301 - "mod use metal ammo type" (mod_use_metal_ammo_type)		- Extremely jank. It DOES switch your ammo type to metal, but it's invisible on non-Engineer classes, and changes your max metal capacity in odd ways. (If I had to guess, it LITERALLY converts your weapon's ammo directly to metal, so a 32-reserve weapon ends up making your class' metal capacity 32. Jank as fuck.)
303 - "mod max primary clip override" (mod_max_primary_clip_override)		- Changes how much ammo is loaded in your clip by force. You can set this to -1 to have your weapon operate solely on its reserves (it DOESN'T reload!).
304 - "sniper full charge damage bonus" (sniper_full_charge_damage_bonus)	- Remember, this also affects fully-charged bodyshots!
305 - "sniper fires tracer" (sniper_fires_tracer)							- Adds a tracer-particle on-top of the regular Sniper Rifle tracer particle. They appear to be slightly offset, so it doesn't look amazing. Recommend just setting a new tracer_effect manually, instead.
306 - "sniper no headshot without full charge" (sniper_no_headshot_without_full_charge)
[TEXT] 307 - "mod no reload DISPLAY ONLY" (mod_no_reload_display_only)		- Text-only: "No reload necessary"
308 - "sniper penetrate players when charged" (sniper_penetrate_players_when_charged)	- Doesn't play the extremely loud fanfare on scoring a multikill, sadly!
309 - "crit kill will gib" (crit_kill_will_gib)								- For any weapon with this, scoring a crit-kill will make enemies explode!! If you're using melee, you can use "mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage" to set this effect - and more!
[MvM] 310 - "recall" (recall)												- MvM canteen stuff. Could use this as cheeky text for something that just bloody kills you!
[TEXT] 311 - "unlimited quantity" (unlimited_quantity)						- Text-only: "Unlimited use"
312 - "disable weapon hiding for animations" (disable_weapon_hiding_for_animations) - Supposed to keep the weapon visible while you do stuff like taunt..? A bit flawed since most taunts just animate the weapons away to begin with...
313 - "applies snare effect" (applies_snare_effect)							- For targets doused in a fluid (like Jarate or Mad Milk), applies a slow effect to them as well.
314 - "uber duration bonus" (add_uber_time)									- No text, modifies über time.
[MvM] 315 - "refill_ammo" (refill_ammo)
318 - "faster reload rate" (fast_reload)
319 - "increase buff duration" (mod_buff_duration)
[MvM] 320 - "robo sapper" (robo_sapper)										- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. However, if you want, you can put an addcond on a weapon, that applies "TF_COND_SAPPED" to enemies on damage, and it -will- stun TFBots.
321 - "build rate bonus" (mod_build_rate)									- Modify building build-rate! Weirdly, doesn't modify the animation speed. I suppose, if you wanted that fixed, you could also use each building's individual build-rate modifiers?
322 - "taunt is press and hold" (enable_misc2_holdtaunt)					- For custom, schema-defined taunts, makes it keep looping its .vcd / animation until you cancel it by jumping. Used for various partner or idling taunts!
323 - "attack projectiles" (attack_projectiles)								- On TF_Weapon_Minigun & TF2C_Weapon_AAGun (!!), firing at flying explosives (rockets, pipes) will destroy them! You have to be about dead-on with the projectile to do so successfully, so it's rather difficult to use this, especially for the AA Gun.
324 - "accuracy scales damage" (accuracy_scales_damage)
[MvM] 325 - "currency bonus" (currency_bonus)								- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. Maybe cute flavor text for a Civilian weapon?
326 - "increased jump height" (mod_jump_height)
[MvM] 327 - "building instant upgrade" (building_instant_upgrade)			- MvM canteen stuff. You can instant-upgrade buildings yourself if you set "add_buildings_upgrade_cost" to, say, -200.
328 - "disable fancy class select anim" (disable_fancy_class_select_anim)
329 - "airblast vulnerability multiplier" (airblast_vulnerability_multiplier)
330 - "override footstep sound set" (override_footstep_sound_set)			- Change what sounds you make as you walk around! Table listed below - also supersedes "mod_armor_footsteps" from Legacy TF2C.
331 - "spawn with physics toy" (spawn_with_physics_toy)						- Spawns a small, teamcolored physics football when set to 1 and present on an item of yours.
332 - "fish damage override" (fish_damage_override)							- Switches the kill-feed text from FISH KILL! to ARM KILL! on TF_Weapon_Bat_Fish. That's gotta be humiliating.
334 - "bombinomicon effect on death" (bombinomicon_effect_on_death)			- Doesn't seem to appear with the matching particles by default, but does make you explode with the sound a few seconds after death. Particles might work if added via mod?
335 - "clip size bonus upgrade" (mult_clipsize_upgrade)
336 - "hide enemy health" (hide_enemy_health)								- Only works on Spy by default, obviously.
337 - "subtract victim medigun charge on hit" (subtract_victim_medigun_charge_onhit)
338 - "subtract victim cloak on hit" (subtract_victim_cloak_on_hit)
339 - "reveal cloaked victim on hit" (reveal_cloaked_victim_on_hit)			- The name doesn't make it clear, I believe these is supposed to forcefully uncloak or undisguise a Spy who you hit. Whoever made this horrendous set of stats was really mad at Spy and Medic, apparently.
340 - "reveal disguised victim on hit" (reveal_disguised_victim_on_hit)
341 - "jarate backstabber" (jarate_backstabber)								- Australian defensive mechanism (pisses himself when attacked)! Work in conjunction with properties that prevent someone from dying on backstab, too, for extra hilarity (or suffering on the Spy's part)!
343 - "engy sentry fire rate increased" (mult_sentry_firerate)
344 - "engy sentry radius increased" (mult_sentry_range)
345 - "engy dispenser radius increased" (mult_dispenser_radius)
346 - "mod bat launches ornaments" (set_weapon_mode)
347 - "freeze backstab victim" (freeze_backstab_victim)						- Only works on backstabs! Turns enemy ragdolls into ice-statues on backstab-kill, and does nothin' otherwise. If this is used at the same time as another non-destructive ragdoll-effect (like gold statues), this takes priority visually, but both seem to trigger.
348 - "fire rate penalty HIDDEN" (mult_postfiredelay)
349 - "energy weapon no drain" (energy_weapon_no_drain)
350 - "ragdolls become ash" (ragdolls_become_ash)
351 - "engy disposable sentries" (engy_disposable_sentries)
[NEED_ASSETS] 352 - "alt fire teleport to spawn" (alt_fire_teleport_to_spawn)	- This needs quite a few assets + response rules lines to work, but it does work! Press reload to bring up a menu, then teleport back to spawn with the Eureka Effect's unique taunt. Oh, it's also exactly 2.0s long, for reference.
353 - "cannot pick up buildings" (cannot_pick_up_buildings)
354 - "stun enemies wielding same weapon" (stun_enemies_wielding_same_weapon)
[TEXT] 355 - "mod ammo per shot missed DISPLAY ONLY" (mod_ammo_per_shot_missed_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- Text-only: "Per Shot Missed: -### ammo"
356 - "airblast disabled" (airblast_disabled)
357 - "increase buff duration HIDDEN" (mod_buff_duration)
358 - "crit forces victim to laugh" (crit_forces_victim_to_laugh)			- Needs a lot of taunt .vcds and responses, but this works as intended! If you deal critical melee damage to an enemy, they play the laugh response and, well, laugh!
359 - "melts in fire" (melts_in_fire)
360 - "damage all connected" (damage_all_connected)
361 - "become fireproof on hit by fire" (become_fireproof_on_hit_by_fire)	- You could use "mult_dmgtaken_from_fire_active" and have it only apply when the weapon is in your hands, for a more general-purpose variant?
362 - "crit from behind" (crit_from_behind)									- Deals crits if you're behind an enemy when they take damage from your weapon! For projectiles, that's relative to you. Seems to use a pretty small cone like the Backburner, instead of a wide 180-degree angle like the Knife. 
363 - "crit does no damage" (crit_does_no_damage)
364 - "add jingle to footsteps" (add_jingle_to_footsteps)					- I got spurs, that jingle-jangle-jingle (Jingle-jangle!).		
365 - "set icicle knife mode" (set_weapon_mode)								- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Knife. Provides a recharge meter, which is used if it melts because of "melts_in_fire"
367 - "extinguish earns revenge crits" (extinguish_revenge)					- For TF_Weapon_Flaregun_Revenge only, extinguishing a teammate with alt-fire will give you one guaranteed crit for each extinguish. Note, you CAN still store up crits even without this attribute, but you won't be able to use them at all, shots will just be normal flare shots.
368 - "burn damage earns rage" (burn_damage_earns_rage)
369 - "tickle enemies wielding same weapon" (tickle_enemies_wielding_same_weapon)
370 - "attach particle effect static" (set_attached_particle_static)
371 - "cosmetic taunt sound" (cosmetic_taunt_sound)							- CUSTOM TAUNT SOUNDS!! Input is a custom soundscript to play, and it'll trigger when you taunt. NOTE, this doesn't precache sounds automatically, so you'll need to figure out a way to get it to precache. If you have a soundscript you're reasonably sure won't get used for any weapon, even an unrelated one, you can try putting your taunt sound there. In Live TF2, this is usually paired with a "custom_sound0" field, but that doesn't appear to really help for precaching...
[NEED_FIXES] 375 - "generate rage on damage" (generate_rage_on_dmg)			- Enables a "rage" meter that builds with damage on TF_Weapon_Minigun, which you can activate using taunt or +attack3 while revved to apply knockback to your shots! Seems to have completely broken firing sounds...?
376 - "aiming no flinch" (aiming_no_flinch)
377 - "aiming knockback resistance" (mult_aiming_knockback_resistance)
378 - "sniper aiming movespeed decreased" (mult_player_aiming_movespeed)
387 - "rage on kill" (rage_on_kill)											- Not as funny as it sounds. This is for the Hitman's Heatmaker's focus-meter - get kills (or assists below), get charge. This doesn't appear to work on any other meter-weapon that can get kills, like the Phlog or Minigun.
389 - "shot penetrate all players" (shot_penetrate_all_players)				- I'm not sure if this works or not? You can use "projectile_penetration" for hitscan to have shots penetrate many targets.
390 - "headshot damage increase" (headshot_damage_modify)
392 - "damage penalty on bodyshot" (bodyshot_damage_modify)
[TEXT] 393 - "sniper rage DISPLAY ONLY" (sniper_rage_DISPLAY_ONLY)			- Text-only: "Only visible in Pyroland"
394 - "fire rate bonus HIDDEN" (mult_postfiredelay)
[MvM] 395 - "explosive sniper shot" (explosive_sniper_shot)					- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. Does radial damage to surrounding enemies on headshot. Starts at a value of 1, but increases up to 3 in the gamemode, increasing radius & damage. Can probably go higher.
396 - "melee attack rate bonus" (mult_postfiredelay)						- Just a text difference for the same firing speed attribute, for melee weapons which swing instead of fire!
397 - "projectile penetration heavy" (projectile_penetration)
398 - "rage on assists" (rage_on_assists)
[MvM] 399 - "armor piercing" (armor_piercing)								- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. Increases backstab damage against armored Giant Robots to an input percentage, to a max of 750 damage per stab. No effect on "set_blockbackstab_once", that still totally blocks backstabs while active. A value of 100 gets 750 dmg, and 50 is 325 DMG.

400 - "cannot pick up intelligence" (cannot_pick_up_intelligence)
402 - "cannot be backstabbed" (cannot_be_backstabbed)						- As it says, backstab-attempts won't even register at all, and it'll just come out as a normal melee swing - no special animation. Note, that this doesn't apply at all to if a melee swing just does more damage from behind (like via "crit_from_behind"), so that'll still work.
[MvM] 404 - "share consumable with patient" (share_consumable_with_patient)	- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. This is an on-weapon effect for healing weapons (Mediguns, 'Naders, etc.) that shares canteen effects when you pop 'em yourself, variable strength.
405 - "airblast vertical vulnerability multiplier" (airblast_vertical_vulnerability_multiplier)
406 - "vision opt in flags" (vision_opt_in_flags)							- Toggles PyroVision, & some other vision-effects with bitflag rules! PV does various things - textures + particles + gibs are changed, items toggle their "model_vision_filtered" visuals if present, and pain noises are laughter, among other things. It's a little buggy, since it's unsupported, but appears mostly functional.
407 - "crit vs disguised players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)
408 - "crit vs non burning players" (or_crit_vs_not_playercond)
409 - "kill forces attacker to laugh" (kill_forces_attacker_to_laugh)		- This is FUNNY AS HELL. It makes you do the laugh taunt after every kill. Leaks onto all equipped items unless you prevent it. 10/10, no notes. Incredible, toxic weapon stat.
410 - "damage bonus while disguised" (mult_dmg_disguised)					- What it says on the tin, damage mult for an attack you do while you were disguised. Theoretically also works if you were to keep your disguise after attacking, too.
411 - "projectile spread angle penalty" (projectile_spread_angle)			- Projectile spread for things like rockets or pipes that don't usually have spread variance.
412 - "dmg taken increased" (mult_dmgtaken)
413 - "auto fires full clip" (auto_fires_full_clip)							- An interesting firemode! Start with 0 ammo loaded, and hold down fire to reload shots until the clip is full. Let go to fire all loaded ammo consecutively!
414 - "self mark for death" (self_mark_for_death)							- Mark yourself for death! Triggers if set to at least 1.0 - values higher will set the time you remain marked after switching to that in seconds. Seems to be conditional. Melee only?
416 - "mod flaregun fires pellets with knockback" (set_weapon_mode)			- Weapon mode for TF_Weapon_Flaregun & TF_Weapon_Flaregun_Revenge. Flares fired from these bounce off enemies on hit, and deal knockback + an extra hit once it lands on the ground.
417 - "can overload" (can_overload)											- When reloading on most weapons, it'll keep going after you've reached max clip, and each subsequent reload will just decrement 1 reserve ammo until you run out. For TF_Weapon_RocketLauncher (& most variants), extra reloads instead cause explosions and decrement loaded ammo by 1!
418 - "boost on damage" (boost_on_damage)									- Builds up meter progress for TF_Weapon_Pep_Brawler_Blaster and TF_Weapon_Soda_Popper on dealing damage. I don't believe it works on other meter-items...?
419 - "hype resets on jump" (hype_resets_on_jump)							- Lose an input percent - out of 100 - from your total meter when you double-jump. A value of 50 would make you lose a culmulative half of the meter, regardless of if you even have that much.
[TEXT] 420 - "pyro year number" (pyro_year_number)							- Text-only: "Witnessed the --- inferno"
421 - "no primary ammo from dispensers while active" (no_primary_ammo_from_dispensers)
422 - "pyrovision only DISPLAY ONLY" (pyrovision_only_display)
424 - "clip size penalty HIDDEN" (mult_clipsize)
425 - "sapper damage bonus" (mult_sapper_damage)							- This accepts negative values, which ends up healing enemy buildings. Yikes.
426 - "sapper damage penalty" (mult_sapper_damage)
427 - "sapper damage leaches health" (sapper_damage_leaches_health)			- Restores a variable amount of health per second, per active Sapper that's on an enemy building! Actually pretty neat! Values of 1-3 HP/s per are probably best.
428 - "sapper health bonus" (mult_sapper_health)							- Note: Sappers have 100 HP by default, and are affected somewhat by an enemy melee's building damage mults.
429 - "sapper health penalty" (mult_sapper_health)
430 - "ring of fire while aiming" (ring_of_fire_while_aiming)				- Emits a pulsing ring of fire that does variable damage while revving a TF_Weapon_Minigun or TF2C_Weapon_AAGun. Fire-pulse range, speed, and frequency are static and can't be changed. This really isn't amazing, but might be okay as a supplement or if you REALLY crank up the damage numbers per tick!
431 - "uses ammo while aiming" (uses_ammo_while_aiming)						- While revved up with a TF_Weapon_Minigun or TF2C_Weapon_AAGun, you'll lose an input amount of ammo per second while continuously spun up even while not firing.
[NEED_ASSETS] 433 - "sapper degenerates buildings" (sapper_degenerates_buildings)	- Has some amusing, but ultimately functional behavior for buildings that are somehow past Lvl 3. Jump Pads won't play their building animation in reverse, but otherwise, this appears to work fine!
434 - "sapper damage penalty hidden" (mult_sapper_damage)
[TEXT] 435 - "cleaver description" (desc_cleaver_description)				- Text-only: "Throw at your enemies to make them bleed! Long distance hits reduce recharge time"
436 - "ragdolls plasma effect" (ragdolls_plasma_effect)
437 - "crit vs stunned players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)
438 - "crit vs wet players" (crit_vs_wet_players)							- Also crits vs. enemies sodden with Jarate / Mad Milk / Gas Passer fx.
440 - "clip size upgrade atomic" (mult_clipsize_upgrade_atomic)
442 - "major move speed bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
443 - "major increased jump height" (mod_jump_height)
444 - "head scale" (head_scale)												- Which side are you on? Big Head mode, or Tiny Head mode? Either way, both work, as well as other player resizers.
[TEXT] 445 - "pyrovision opt in DISPLAY ONLY" (pyrovision_opt_in_display_only)- Text-only: "On Equip: Visit Pyroland"
448 - "player skin override" (player_skin_override)							- Jank skin override for the old Voodoo-cursed soul zombie skins. Setting this to "1" seems to shift all skins over by 4; RED / BLU become GRN + YLW, and GRN / YLW become the Global Disguise skin, and Übercharged Global skin. Higher values do nothing.
450 - "zombiezombiezombiezombie" (zombiezombiezombiezombie)					- I don't think this does anything, but there's a small chance it MIGHT be used for some Halloween responses for a few of the zombie skins. Useless as-is.
451 - "sapper voice pak" (sapper_voice_pak)									- On TF_Weapon_Sapper, enables the Ap-Sap's Wheatley voice idles when set to 1, higher values don't appear to do anything.
452 - "sapper voice pak idle wait" (sapper_voice_pak_idle_wait)
464 - "engineer sentry build rate multiplier" (sentry_build_rate_multiplier)	- For all Building build-rates, higher numbers are faster building, and lower numbers are slower.
465 - "engineer teleporter build rate multiplier" (teleporter_build_rate_multiplier)
466 - "grenade launcher mortar mode" (grenade_launcher_mortar_mode)			- On TF_Weapon_Cannon only, switch wpn behavior. Hold to increase speed + decrease fuse. Blows up if it overcharges!
[TEXT] 467 - "grenade not explode on impact" (grenade_not_explode_on_impact)	- This is probably display-only text, this doesn't do anything to regular pill-grenades, and is also already innate to cannonbomb projectiles, 
469 - "engineer building teleporting pickup" (building_teleporting_pickup)	- Pick up a building of yours at long-range for a variable amount of metal! Surprisingly, this works seperately on basically every one of Engineer's weapons, as long as it doesn't natively have an alt-fire function at range (sorry, Wrangler and SC fans!).
470 - "grenade damage reduction on world contact" (grenade_damage_reduction_on_world_contact)	- Despite the name, this is general-purpose! Lower OR raise damage for your explosives after they've bounced against a surface in world! The choice... is yours.
472 - "mark for death on building pickup" (mark_for_death_on_building_pickup)	- This is global (and has to be) - if you ever pick up any building, you'll be under MfD.
473 - "medigun charge is resists" (set_charge_type)							- Vaccinator has 3 Übercharges (3, 4, and 5), and its weapon mode (somehow) lets it switch between those 3. You're free to use these for any Medigun or 'Nader, but don't try to use Vaccinator's weapon mode for anything else, it hates it...
474 - "arrow heals buildings" (arrow_heals_buildings)						- Allows repair-bolts (note: NOT the default projectile for TF_Weapon_Shotgun_Building_Rescue!!) to heal friendly buildings by a variable amount, metal-allowing. It takes 1/4th of the healing done per shot as metal, and that's static.
475 - "Projectile speed increased HIDDEN" (mult_projectile_speed)
476 - "damage bonus HIDDEN" (mult_dmg)
477 - "cannonball push back" (cannonball_push_back)
478 - "rage giving scale" (rage_giving_scale)
479 - "overheal fill rate reduced" (overheal_fill_rate)						- Modifies how long it takes for Overheal to fill to its max, when applicable! Higher values for faster overheal-fill. 
[MvM] 481 - "canteen specialist" (canteen_specialist)						- MvM only - no effects outside of the gamemode. I think this is display-only text for "share_consumable_with_patient"? I'm unsure...
482 - "overheal expert" (overheal_expert)									- Point-based stat, goes up to at least "4". Works outside MvM! - Adds +25% max Overheal and +50% longer overheal per point (around +100% max overheal and +200% longer overheal at MvM's max - scary!) 
484 - "mad milk syringes" (mad_milk_syringes)								- For TF_Weapon_SyringeGun and TF2C_Weapon_Nailgun (though it's probably anything that fires syringe-based projectiles), applies Mad Milk's effect to enemies for about 1s per hit, up to 4s maximum.
488 - "rocket specialist" (rocket_specialist)								- Point-based stat, goes up to at least "4". Works outside MvM! - Adds +15% proj. speed & blast radius, and rockets stun + do max damage on hit (around +60% proj. speed & radius at MvM's max. You get the rocket stun + damage buffs immediately!!) 
493 - "healing mastery" (healing_mastery)									- Point-based stat, goes up to at least "4". Works outside MvM! - Adds +25% heal, self-heal, & revive rate per point (around +100% heal & revive rate at MvM's max. Scary, but less insane than the others so far...) 
[MvM] 498 - "bot custom jump particle" (bot_custom_jump_particle)			- Intended for MvM Robots...? This seems to be used to spawn a custom jump particle if set to 1, but I can't get it to do anything.
[NEED_ASSETS] 499 - "generate rage on heal" (generate_rage_on_heal)			- The Projectile Shield from MvM! It seems to work perfectly fine outside of it, albeit quite terrifyingly so. Build meter very quickly by healing teammates with a TF_Weapon_Medigun, and press +attack3 to activate the shield. It shreds through enemy health and your eardrums with 1 tick of 1 dmg every frame. It's also missing some assets...

503 - "medigun bullet resist passive" (medigun_bullet_resist_passive)		- Applies while healing with a Vaccinator ("set_weapon_mode" and "set_charge_type" both set to 3 - it's really complicated and fickle).
504 - "medigun blast resist passive" (medigun_blast_resist_passive)
505 - "medigun fire resist passive" (medigun_fire_resist_passive)
506 - "medigun bullet resist deployed" (medigun_bullet_resist_deployed)
507 - "medigun blast resist deployed" (medigun_blast_resist_deployed)
508 - "medigun fire resist deployed" (medigun_fire_resist_deployed)
509 - "medigun crit bullet percent bar deplete" (medigun_crit_bullet_percent_bar_deplete)
510 - "medigun crit blast percent bar deplete" (medigun_crit_blast_percent_bar_deplete)
511 - "medigun crit fire percent bar deplete" (medigun_crit_fire_percent_bar_deplete)
518 - "scattergun knockback mult" (scattergun_knockback_mult)				- As the name implies, this is a modifier for knockback from "set_scattergun_has_knockback". ONLY works for that! It works as you'd expect though.
519 - "particle effect vertical offset" (particle_effect_vertical_offset)
520 - "particle effect use head origin" (particle_effect_use_head_origin)
[MvM] 521 - "use large smoke explosion" (use_large_smoke_explosion)			- Intended for MvM Robots...? I'd guess it's for the Sentry Buster explosion effect, but I can't get it to do anything.
522 - "damage causes airblast" (damage_causes_airblast)						- Despite the name, this seems to be used often in MvM as a generic strong-knockback effect. Hey, you can use it for that, too!
524 - "increased jump height from weapon" (mod_jump_height_from_weapon)
525 - "damage force increase" (damage_force_reduction)
526 - "healing received bonus" (mult_healing_received)
527 - "afterburn immunity" (afterburn_immunity)
532 - "hype decays over time" (hype_decays_over_time)
534 - "airblast vulnerability multiplier hidden" (airblast_vulnerability_multiplier)
535 - "damage force increase hidden" (damage_force_reduction)
536 - "damage force increase text" (damage_force_reduction)
[MvM] 545 - "bot medic uber health threshold" (bot_medic_uber_health_threshold)	- Intended for MvM Robots...? These two probably control the health percentage and delay before using an Übercharge when a Medic feels threatened.
546 - "bot medic uber deploy delay duration" (bot_medic_uber_deploy_delay_duration)
547 - "single wep deploy time decreased" (mult_single_wep_deploy_time)
548 - "halloween reload time decreased" (hwn_mult_reload_time)				- These are interesting - they aren't on-weapon, but on-wearer, so they'll also modify the reload / firerates of any guns you have on your person!! Very, very interesting!
549 - "halloween fire rate bonus" (hwn_mult_postfiredelay)					- This doesn't work on Melees, for better or worse.
550 - "halloween increased jump height" (mod_jump_height)
551 - "special taunt" (special_taunt)										- If a weapon has a taunt that SHOULD NOT be canceled by say, Thriller or April Fool's Laugh, put this on it. Applicable for stuff that taunt-kills and consumables.
554 - "revive" (revive)
556 - "taunt attack name" (taunt_attack_name)								- For custom, schema-defined taunts, defines what taunt-effect to use for the purposes of doing things, usually taunt-kills but sometimes other stuff. This is a set list in-code, I'll compile ones I know of in a section below;
557 - "taunt attack time" (taunt_attack_time)								- ...continuing from above, this defines the time after the taunt started when the taunt-effects happen!

600 - "taunt force move forward" (taunt_force_move_forward)					- Conga, conga, conga! For custom, schema-defined taunts, forces the player to move forward at a speed defined by "taunt_move_speed", if present! Otherwise, you just stay still anyway, speed of 0 and all.
602 - "taunt mimic" (taunt_mimic)											- For custom, schema-defined taunts, lets other players join in by taunting next to you! Seems to only work for looping taunts that are ALSO defined as partner taunts, and the joining class has an equivalent taunt .vcd defined!
606 - "taunt success sound" (taunt_success_sound)							- For custom, schema-defined taunts, play a single-use soundscript when the taunt begins. Include a "custom_sound0" soundscript of the same name, for precaching reasons. Pretty similar to "cosmetic_taunt_sound"! 
607 - "taunt success sound offset" (taunt_success_sound_offset)
608 - "taunt success sound loop" (taunt_success_sound_loop)					- For custom, schema-defined taunts, play a looping soundscript and have it continue until the taunt ends. Include a "custom_sound2" soundscript of the same name, for precaching reasons.
609 - "taunt success sound loop offset" (taunt_success_sound_loop_offset)
610 - "increased air control" (mod_air_control)								- This isn't immediately obvious. This increases or decreases how much you can move / strafe while airborne with just your movement keys. Maybe better wording would be like, "+200% air movement speed"? Also, high values make it extremely hard to strafe-jump.
613 - "minicritboost on kill" (add_onkill_minicritboost_time)
614 - "no metal from dispensers while active" (no_metal_from_dispensers_while_active)
619 - "closerange backattack minicrits" (closerange_backattack_minicrits)	- For what it is, this is essentially a generic minicrits-from-behind, which is nice! It only stops dealing minicrits outside of midrange, after which it probably wouldn't even matter for most classes that'd use this stat anyway!
620 - "torso scale" (torso_scale)											- This is the funniest attribute ever. You use it yourself and see what it does, I won't spoil it for you. Engineer for best results.
621 - "rocketjump attackrate bonus" (rocketjump_attackrate_bonus)			- When actively blast-jumping on Soldier, raises or lowers firerate for your weapon while still airborne! Sadly, doesn't appear to work for melees.
[TEXT] 632 - "rj air bombardment" (rj_air_bombardment)						- Text-only: "Fires 3 barrages while explosive jumping" - maybe this used to be like the Beggar's salvo but with a cluster of rockets replacing the other 3 loaded rockets? This is nonfunctional now, as far as I can tell.
636 - "sniper crit no scope" (sniper_crit_no_scope)							- Allows hipfire headshots while using TF_Weapon_SniperRifle_Classic, doesn't do anything for the other rifles or any other weapon. For those, you can just use "can_headshot" instead!
[TEXT] 637 - "sniper independent zoom DISPLAY ONLY" (sniper_independent_zoom_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- Text-only: "Zoom does not affect charge"
638 - "axtinguisher properties" (axtinguisher_properties)					- HORRIFYINGLY, this is completely general-purpose and can go onto any damaging weapon. Deal 100% mini-crits to burning players, and full crits if you attack them from behind!
639 - "full charge turn control" (charge_turn_control)
640 - "parachute attribute" (parachute_attribute)							- Surprisingly, not tied to an item_class, add it to anything. If you press jump while in the air, activate an invisible parachute that slows your falling speed, among other things! It can be paired with TF_Weapon_Parachute and "set_buff_type" set to 4, for visuals, but it works fine without...!?
641 - "taunt force weapon slot" (taunt_force_weapon_slot)					- Switches over to a weapon slot and then taunts. Kinda vestigial here, since no action-taunts exist and the only means of taunting is weapon-taunts. Might be useful for things without taunts like the PDAs?
642 - "mini rockets" (mini_rockets)											- Changes rocket visuals over to a special rocket while using TF_Weapon_RocketLauncher_AirStrike, with a spinning anim and custom particles for its trail that change if blast jumping.
643 - "rocket jump damage reduction HIDDEN" (rocket_jump_dmg_reduction)
[NEED_FEATURES] 644 - "clipsize increase on kill" (clipsize_increase_on_kill)	- For TF_Weapon_RocketLauncher_AirStrike, increases your clipsize by a variable amount on kill. The item_class seems to have code to cap it at +4 your default clipsize. Legacy TF2C had a more general-purpose version, that also was paired with a helper attribute, "clipsize_increase_on_kill_cap".
646 - "taunt turn speed" (taunt_turn_speed)									- Only usable for schema-defined taunts if they're press-and-hold and you're able to move.
647 - "sniper fires tracer HIDDEN" (sniper_fires_tracer_HIDDEN)
651 - "fire rate bonus with reduced health" (mult_postfiredelay_with_reduced_health) - A pretty strange one, but it does what it says on the tin. Firerate slowly increments / decrements to the listed value (from 1, your default) as you lose health. Does NOT work for melees (sadly)
669 - "stickybomb fizzle time" (stickybomb_fizzle_time)						- Active stickybombs of yours will fizzle out on their own after a variable amount of time idle, in seconds.
670 - "stickybomb charge rate" (stickybomb_charge_rate)						- How long it takes to fully charge a Stickybomb launch. Game multiplies your inputted var by about 4 for the amount of seconds it takes.
671 - "grenade no bounce" (grenade_no_bounce)								- Grenade-based projectiles fired will have very little impact and movement in general after hitting surfaces. They won't be stationary, but they'll mostly stay still assuming flat terrain. Combine with "grenade_no_spin" for extremely unmoving grenades!
674 - "class select override vcd" (class_select_override_vcd) 				- Force the class to play a different ".vcd" animation on the Class Select screen. Useful.
675 - "custom projectile model" (custom_projectile_model)					- Set a custom model for the projectile - if it supports it. Rockets, Pipes, and Stickies fit this bill, currently!
676 - "lose demo charge on damage when charging" (lose_demo_charge_on_damage_when_charging)	- APPARENTLY, this handles most of the Tide Turner's downsides all in one. Lose some charge if hit while charging, but ALSO makes your strikes only deal mini-crit damage. No way to decouple these as far as I can tell.
681 - "grenade no spin" (grenade_no_spin)									- Grenades fly true in the air and don't tumble at all.
684 - "grenade detonation damage penalty" (grenade_detonation_damage_penalty)	- Somewhat similar to "grenade_damage_reduction_on_world_contact", you can raise or lower the damage grenades do if they explode via fuse, airborne or grounded. Really, these two attributes are just splitting hairs!
687 - "taunt turn acceleration time" (taunt_turn_acceleration_time)
688 - "taunt move acceleration time" (taunt_move_acceleration)
689 - "taunt move speed" (taunt_move_speed)									- For custom, schema-defined taunts, how fast can you move around? This only affects press-and-hold taunts, to my understanding, and you'll only be able to directly move forwards and back. Turning, if allowed, is handled by "taunt_turn_speed"
698 - "disable weapon switch" (disable_weapon_switch)						- On-wearer, so it'll take effect immediately. Won't let you switch even if you run out of ammo or somehow lose the weapon in that slot...
699 - "hand scale" (hand_scale)												- I don't recommend using this, it's the least effective of all the body-scaling attributes. Increases or decreases the size of the hands and everything attached to them, like weapons. Looks pretty bad on everything but Melees.

704 - "unlimited quantity hidden" (unlimited_quantity)
[TEXT] 708 - "panic_attack" (panic_attack)									- Text-only: "Hold fire to load up to 4 shells"
[TEXT] 709 - "panic_attack_negative" (panic_attack_negative)				- Text-only: "Weapon spread increases as health decreases"
710 - "auto fires full clip penalty" (auto_fires_full_clip)
711 - "auto fires when full" (auto_fires_when_full)							- Fires your weapon once upon it reaching full ammo - this can repeat if the weapon only ever holds 1 ammo. Using alongside "auto_fires_full_clip" works as expected, you'll fire all shots loaded once the weapon is full.
712 - "force weapon switch" (force_weapon_switch)
726 - "cloak_consume_on_feign_death_activate" (cloak_consume_on_feign_death_activate)
727 - "stickybomb_charge_damage_increase" (stickybomb_charge_damage_increase)
728 - "NoCloakWhenCloaked" (NoCloakWhenCloaked)								- Unable to regenerate cloak from ammo packs or Dispensers while cloaked.
729 - "ReducedCloakFromAmmo" (ReducedCloakFromAmmo)
732 - "metal_pickup_decreased" (mult_metal_pickup)
733 - "lose hype on take damage" (lose_hype_on_take_damage)
734 - "healing received penalty" (mult_healing_received)
[TEXT] 735 - "crit_vs_burning_FLARES_DISPLAY_ONLY" (crit_vs_burning_FLARES_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- Text-only: "100% critical hit vs. burning players"
736 - "speed_boost_on_kill" (speed_boost_on_kill)							- Both of these accept speed-boost duration to give, as an input in seconds.
737 - "speed_boost_on_hit" (speed_boost_on_hit)
738 - "spunup_damage_resistance" (spunup_damage_resistance)					- The stat's wording is a bit weird. If you take damage, and it'd bring you down to 50% health or lower, THEN apply a variable amount of resistance (or vuln??) to it.
739 - "ubercharge overheal rate penalty" (mult_medigun_overheal_uberchargerate) - If the patient is overhealed, modify the übercharge gain rate! Presumably nuking it into the ground.
740 - "reduced_healing_from_medics" (mult_healing_from_medics)				- As it says, just restrictions for Medics. Dispensers and Health packs go unaffected.
741 - "health on radius damage" (add_health_on_radius_damage)				- ONLY works on explosives!! Adds a variable amount of health on hit, dependent on how much damage was dealt total, which goes up to a cap you can define. "20" would mean you can heal, at most, 20 HP per hit if you do a lot of damage in that one hit.
772 - "single wep holster time increased" (mult_switch_from_wep_deploy_time) - Modifies weapon-switch speed when switching off this weapon to another.
773 - "single wep deploy time increased" (mult_single_wep_deploy_time)		- Modifies weapon-switch speed when switching to this weapon.
774 - "charge time decreased" (mod_charge_time)
775 - "dmg penalty vs buildings" (mult_dmg_vs_buildings)
776 - "charge impact damage decreased" (charge_impact_damage)
778 - "charge meter on hit" (charge_meter_on_hit)
779 - "minicrit_boost_when_charged" (minicrit_boost_when_charged)			- These two are both used together by TF_Weapon_Charged_SMG! Activate a variable-duration minicrit boost with alt-fire once the meter is full. Can switch to other weapons while the boost is going to dish out pain.
780 - "minicrit_boost_charge_rate" (minicrit_boost_charge_rate)				- Alter how fast TF_Weapon_Charged_SMG's meter builds with damage. Probably good to lower it, it fills practically instantly at the default of 1!!
781 - "is_a_sword" (is_a_sword)												- Well, is it? In seriousness, this extends your melee range by some variable amount of hammer units, I think...
782 - "ammo gives charge" (ammo_gives_charge)
783 - "extinguish restores health" (extinguish_restores_health)
784 - "extinguish reduces cooldown" (extinguish_reduces_cooldown)			- This is for TF_Weapon_Jar & variants, primarily.
787 - "fuse bonus" (fuse_mult)												- As of now, this only works for regular pill-grenades and not any variants...
788 - "move speed bonus shield required" (mult_player_movespeed_shieldrequired)	- Total hogwash stat that only exists to stomp Hybridknight into the ground, 0/10
789 - "damage bonus bullet vs sentry target" (mult_dmg_bullet_vs_sentry_target)	- For hitscan-bullets only, damage multiplier toward your Sentry's current target that it's trying to shoot. No effect on bullet-adjacent projectiles like syringes or nails, sorry!
790 - "mod teleporter cost" (mod_teleporter_cost)
791 - "damage blast push" (damage_blast_push)								- No text, but this is really useful!! It's a modifier to explosive push force toward enemies, if you'd like it to push enemies more or less. Works with negatives to amusing effect.
793 - "hype on damage" (hype_on_damage)
794 - "dmg taken from fire reduced on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire_active)
795 - "damage bonus vs burning" (mult_dmg_vs_burning)
796 - "min_viewmodel_offset" (min_viewmodel_offset)							- Used for "tf_use_min_viewmodels 1" to shift the VM's position (usually a bit down and a tiny bit forward).
797 - "dmg pierces resists absorbs" (mod_pierce_resists_absorbs)			- Damage dealt will ignore most resistances (like from stats) and absorption effects (like Vacc. or Civilian's def. buff), among other things, and do full damage either way!
798 - "energy buff dmg taken multiplier" (energy_buff_dmg_taken_multiplier)	- While under the effects of TF_COND_ENERGY_BUFF (Cond 19, it's a minicrit buff), modifies damage taken! Surprisingly, only used by the Buffalo Steak Sandvich. Crit-a-Cola uses a different effect.
[TEXT] 799 - "lose revenge crits on death DISPLAY ONLY" (lose_revenge_crits_on_death_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- Text-only: "Revenge crits are lost on death"

800 - "patient overheal penalty" (mult_patient_overheal_penalty)
801 - "item_meter_charge_rate" (item_meter_charge_rate)						- This is used instead of "effectbar_recharge_rate" for a few item_classes? It's used at least on TF_Weapon_Lunchbox + TF_Weapon_Jar (& variants!), as well as TF_Weapon_RocketLauncher_Fireball, TF_Weapon_RocketPack, and TF_Wearable_Razorback. Maybe more, I don't really wanna check everything!
804 - "mult_spread_scale_first_shot" (mult_spread_scale_first_shot)			- Super weird. For hitscan bullets, causes the first pellet fired out of a weapon to have modified accuracy, with the rest of your pellets / shots being unaffected until you pause briefly. For example, one pellet from each Shotgun shot has changed spread, and only the first bullet of a Pistol has the spread until you stop shooting.
807 - "add_head_on_kill" (add_head_on_kill)									- This seems to only work for TF_Weapon_Bonesaw with "ubercharge_preserved_on_spawn_max". When you get a kill, in addition to the usual "organ" you'd collect from the hit, you get 1 additional added from the kill. Non-modifiable.
808 - "mult_spread_scales_consecutive" (mult_spread_scales_consecutive)		- For hitscan bullets, your first shot from full ammo has the best accuracy, and all of your shots afterward - even with pauses - have slightly worse spread per shot until you reload to full ammo!
809 - "fixed_shot_pattern" (fixed_shot_pattern)								- For TF_Weapon_Shotgun and TF_Weapon_Scattergun (& variants), changes their completely-random spread to a consistent, evenly-spaced square shaped spread pattern.
810 - "mod_cloak_no_regen_from_items" (mod_cloak_no_regen_from_items)		- Completely disables cloak meter refilling from ammo packs, dispensers, and other similar sources. You can still get cloak back from a Resupply (of course), as well as on-hit or on-kill cloak gain effects from other items!
811 - "ubercharge_preserved_on_spawn_max" (ubercharge_preserved_on_spawn_max)	- For TF_Weapon_Bonesaw, hit people to store organs! Input is max percentage of Über you can respawn with, assuming you have the required "organs" (Each hit stores 15%. 7 is sufficient for the maximum restoration of 100% Übercharge!).
812 - "mod_air_control_blast_jump" (mod_air_control_blast_jump)
816 - "mod_disguise_consumes_cloak" (mod_disguise_consumes_cloak)			- Can be on any weapon, as long as it's currently on Spy. Fully drains the cloak meter at the moment of a manual-disguise.
818 - "is_passive_weapon" (is_passive_weapon)
819 - "no_jump" (no_jump)													- These 3 are surprisingly functional, albeit only no attack is useful for disabling attacking...
820 - "no_duck" (no_duck)
821 - "no_attack" (no_attack)												- Also disables alt-fires.
822 - "airblast_destroy_projectile" (airblast_destroy_projectile)			- When you try airblasting a projectile, it immediately disappears with no other visual or audio feedback. I guess it works...?
823 - "airblast_pushback_disabled" (airblast_pushback_disabled)
824 - "airblast_pushback_no_stun" (airblast_pushback_no_stun)				- Not entirely sure, but I think this makes it slightly easier for opponents to move against the airblast. It usually applies a few effects to make movement difficult, and I think this removes them...?
825 - "airblast_pushback_no_viewpunch" (airblast_pushback_no_viewpunch)
826 - "airblast_deflect_projectiles_disabled" (airblast_deflect_projectiles_disabled)
827 - "airblast_put_out_teammate_disabled" (airblast_put_out_teammate_disabled)	- ...why though?
831 - "mult_end_flame_size" (mult_end_flame_size)
832 - "airblast_give_teammate_speed_boost" (airblast_give_teammate_speed_boost)	- This is actually really cool. When you airblast a teammate (in general, they don't need to be on fire or anything), applies about 1s of speed-boost to them and 2s of speed-boost to yourself!!
833 - "airblast_turn_projectile_to_ammo" (airblast_turn_projectile_to_ammo)	- Airblasting a projectile successfully turns it into a small ammo pack! On regular flamethrowers, this generally restores just as much as it cost to airblast, but it can vary.
837 - "redirected_flame_size_mult" (redirected_flame_size_mult)
838 - "flame_reflect_on_collision" (flame_reflect_on_collision)				- Makes Flamethrower fire reflect off of hit surfaces at an angle, instead of sliding! Super weird, but super neat!
839 - "flame_spread_degree" (flame_spread_degree)							- Weapon spread for Flamethrower fire. Very weird, since it applies to every individual flame particle, but it works...?
840 - "holster_anim_time" (holster_anim_time)								- Weapon holstering!! When you try to switch to another weapon, there's a pause of variable length before you switch off of your current weapon. Your weapon will try to play a holstering animation, too, using (I think) ACT_VM_HOLSTER or ACT_-animslot-_VM_HOLSTER.
841 - "flame_gravity" (flame_gravity)
842 - "flame_ignore_player_velocity" (flame_ignore_player_velocity)
843 - "flame_drag" (flame_drag)												- In a strange way, this can be used to modify Flamethrower range. Modifies fake air-resistance for the flamethrower flame particles - lower is less (goes farther, spread out), higher is more (stays closer, bunched-up).
844 - "flame_speed" (flame_speed)											- This works to change flame particle speed, but requires INCREDIBLY HUGE numbers! A value of 2500 will bring flame range to "normal", or close to it. Higher values are faster speeds, so increment or decrement by 100's.
845 - "grenades1_resupply_denied" (grenades1_resupply_denied)				- Appears to work, but inconsistent at best. Seems to most reliably work on things that use Grenades1 ammo as actual ammo, like TF_Weapon_Grenade_MIRV or TF_Weapon_Jar?
846 - "grenades2_resupply_denied" (grenades2_resupply_denied)
847 - "grenades3_resupply_denied" (grenades3_resupply_denied)
848 - "item_meter_resupply_denied" (item_meter_resupply_denied)
851 - "mult_player_movespeed_active" (mult_player_movespeed_active)
852 - "mult_dmgtaken_active" (mult_dmgtaken_active)
853 - "mult_patient_overheal_penalty_active" (mult_patient_overheal_penalty_active)
854 - "mult_health_fromhealers_penalty_active" (mult_health_fromhealers_penalty_active)
855 - "mod_maxhealth_drain_rate" (mod_maxhealth_drain_rate)					- While this weapon is held out, lowers maxhealth by 20 immediately and then drain it by a variable amount per second. Once your maxhealth reaches 100, it stops. Switching away will restore your maxhealth to normal at the same rate. If your default maxhealth is LOWER than 100 HP, then this will instead boost it to 100 while active!
856 - "item_meter_charge_type" (item_meter_charge_type)						- Switches how item meters recharge. "1" is used for most; recharges automatically over time. "2" and "3" work with "item_meter_damage_for_full_charge"; 2 disables automatic recharging entirely, you need dmg to fill it, and 3 lets the meter recharge automatically AND get built with damage.
859 - "max_flame_reflection_count" (max_flame_reflection_count)				- Used with "flame_reflect_on_collision", how many times total fire is allowed to bounce off of different surfaces. Once out, flames just act like normal again.
860 - "flame_reflection_add_life_time" (flame_reflection_add_life_time)
861 - "reflected_flame_dmg_reduction" (reflected_flame_dmg_reduction)
862 - "flame_lifetime" (flame_lifetime)										- Seems like this affects how long flames linger around on surfaces after firing 'em. Can be used to do extra damage to enemies near walls. Anyway, this lengthens or reduces that time, to make that more or less effective!
863 - "flame_random_life_time_offset" (flame_random_life_time_offset)
865 - "flame_up_speed" (flame_up_speed)										- Adjust flame speed up or downward - negative makes 'em go down as if affected by gravity. Change numbers in increments of 100's to notice anything.
868 - "crit_dmg_falloff" (crit_dmg_falloff)									- This is a binary toggle - if it's enabled, then Crits suffer falloff like everything else!
869 - "crits_become_minicrits" (crits_become_minicrits)						- All crits, even random ones, become minicrits with this attrib. Surprisingly, affects backstabs! (though those are still 1HKOs no matter what - doing [Current HP x 2 x 1.35]). Also, this has a slightly different name in Legacy TF2C - "crits become minicrits" with no underscores. Huh.
870 - "falling_impact_radius_pushback" (falling_impact_radius_pushback)		- Both of these seem to only work for TF_Weapon_RocketPack. This is supposed to send enemies away, but I haven't been able to get that to work...?
871 - "falling_impact_radius_stun" (falling_impact_radius_stun)				- Inflicts 4-6s of stun on landing - scary!!
872 - "thermal_thruster_air_launch" (thermal_thruster_air_launch)			- Lets you use the Thermal Thruster while midair. Feels awesome, but it provides such enormous mobility it'd need massive nerfs to compensate...
873 - "thermal_thruster" (thermal_thruster)
874 - "mult_item_meter_charge_rate" (mult_item_meter_charge_rate)
[NEED_ASSETS] 875 - "explode_on_ignite" (explode_on_ignite)					- When hitting and igniting enemies that are affected by TF_COND_GAS, makes them explode in a gigantic radius for 350 dmg (YIKES!!). No way as far as I know to reduce the radius or damage... Also, missing some sort of gas-explosion particle by default. Dammit!
876 - "lunchbox healing decreased" (lunchbox_healing_scale)					- Finally works! Does as you'd expect, changes how much you get healed per tick. Does NOT work with negatives, so no hurting yourself via eating!
877 - "speed_boost_on_hit_enemy" (speed_boost_on_hit_enemy)					- For melee weapons only, adds about 1s of speed boost to yourself on hit enemy. Can replicate by having an "add_onhit_addcond_self" that gives you haste or something similar, you can modify duration that way as well!
[TEXT] 878 - "item_meter_starts_empty_DISPLAY_ONLY" (item_meter_starts_empty_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- Text-only: "Gas meter starts empty"
[TEXT] 879 - "item_meter_charge_type_3_DISPLAY_ONLY" (item_meter_charge_type_3_DISPLAY_ONLY))	- Text-only: "Gas meter builds with damage done and/or time"
[TEXT] 880 - "repair health to metal ratio DISPLAY ONLY" (repair_health_to_metal_ratio_DISPLAY_ONLY))	- Text-only: "1-to-1 health-to-metal ratio when repairing buildings"
881 - "health drain medic" (add_health_regen)

1000 - "CARD: damage bonus" (mult_dmg)
1001 - "CARD: dmg taken from bullets reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
1002 - "CARD: move speed bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
1003 - "CARD: health regen" (add_health_regen)
1005 - "SPELL: set Halloween footstep type" (halloween_footstep_type)		- HALLOWEEN ONLY: Provides some scary-looking (hell)fire particles as you walk! Colors are... completely custom!? But, there's a few pre-defined colors in a lookup table below;
1006 - "SPELL: Halloween voice modulation" (halloween_voice_modulation)		- HALLOWEEN ONLY: Lowers your voice pitch by about 20% or so. Spooky! Delightfully devilish! Might be replacable with "voice_pitch_scale"!
1007 - "SPELL: Halloween pumpkin explosions" (halloween_pumpkin_explosions)	- HALLOWEEN ONLY: Replaces (most) explosives' particles with a gut-wrenching pumpkin explosion! Also (supposed to) replace rocket-projectiles' trails, but the particle is missing...
1008 - "SPELL: Halloween green flames" (halloween_green_flames)				- HALLOWEEN ONLY: Puts copper into your Flamethrowers' fuel system and makes flamethrower fire for all teams a ghoulish-looking green! Also, includes very broken afterburn particles - whoops!
1009 - "SPELL: Halloween death ghosts" (halloween_death_ghosts)				- HALLOWEEN ONLY: Makes enemy souls leave their bodies with some spine-tingling little ghosts! Only seems to work for RED or BLU enemies slain, GRN and YLW apparently don't have souls to give. Cheapskates...
1030 - "Attack not cancel charge" (attack_not_cancel_charge)

2021 - "additional halloween response criteria name" (additional_halloween_response_criteria_name)
2029 - "allowed in medieval mode" (allowed_in_medieval_mode)
2030 - "crit on hard hit" (crit_on_hard_hit)								- The name doesn't really match what it does. When you land a critical-kill against an enemy, they explode violently into gibs - complete with cheerful, festive red mist!
2034 - "kill refills meter" (kill_refills_meter)
2041 - "taunt attach particle index"										- For custom, schema-defined taunts, attaches a particle-system while actively taunting! Goes away once it's finished. As before, check the "attribute_controlled_attached_particles" section in the default item schema to find a full list of valid particles (and maybe add your own if you're a go-getter!).
2043 - "upgrade rate decrease" (upgrade_rate_mod)							- Modifies amount of metal you put into a building when hitting it with your Wrench.
2048 - "voice pitch scale" (voice_pitch_scale)
[TEXT] 2049 - "gunslinger punch combo" (gunslinger_punch_combo)				- Text-only: "Third successful punch in a row always crits"
[TEXT] 2053 - "is_festivized" (is_festivized)								- Text-only: "Festivized"
2058 - "meter_label" (meter_label)											- Used to change text on things that have item meters, which there's a lot of now...!
2059 - "item_meter_damage_for_full_charge" (item_meter_damage_for_full_charge)	- If an item meter is allowed to, how much total damage dealt is required to completely fill up the meter?
2062 - "airblast cost scale hidden" (mult_airblast_cost)
[TEXT] 2063 - "dragons fury positive properties" (dragons_fury_positive_properties)	- These 3 are text-only, and are VERY lengthy and specific, so I'm not going to write them out.
[TEXT] 2064 - "dragons fury negative properties" (dragons_fury_negative_properties)
[TEXT] 2065 - "dragons fury neutral properties" (dragons_fury_neutral_properties)
2067 - "attack_minicrits_and_consumes_burning" (attack_minicrits_and_consumes_burning) - Extremely complicated for some reason. On melees only, deal a varying amount of minicrit dmg based on how much afterburn the target has remaining, decreasing over time. Extinguishes enemies after hit. Also gives you a 3s speedboost on kill. Geez, that's a lot...

[NEED_FIXES, TEXT] ???? - "fires healing bolts" (fires_healing_bolts)		- Text-only: "Fires special bolts that heal teammates and deal damage based on distance traveled". NOTE, since there's no other place to mention this here; TF_Weapon_Crossbow currently can't hit teammates by default, you need a server-setting, "tf2c_projectiles_pass_teammates 0", to get it to work.

//--SET BONUS ATTRIBUTES - Attributes that TECHNICALLY work, but are disabled forcibly--
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE: ALL Set Bonus stats are disabled in TF2C for... some reason. The effects of them are otherwise functional, though, so these attributes DO all work, but you'll need to find / make new ones with the same attribute class.]

[DISABLED] 159 - "SET BONUS: cloak blink time penalty" (cloak_blink_time_penalty)
[DISABLED] 160 - "SET BONUS: quiet unstealth" (set_quiet_unstealth)				- This almost totally mutes your uncloak. A bit OP, at least I think so.
[DISABLED] 169 - "SET BONUS: dmg from sentry reduced" (dmg_from_sentry_reduced)
[DISABLED] 176 - "SET BONUS: no death from headshots" (no_death_from_headshots)
[DISABLED] 333 - "SET BONUS: special dsp" (special_dsp)							- Applies sound-filters and other effects onto your voicelines and some player sounds. There are MANY of them, so read up on them (and find a list) on VDC here; https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/DSP
[DISABLED, TEXT] 391 - "SET BONUS: mystery solving time decrease" (mystery_solving_time_decrease)	- Text-only: "Reduces mystery solving time by up to ---%"

[DISABLED] 537 - "SET BONUS: calling card on kill" (calling_card_on_kill)		- Spawns a little gravestone physics prop on kill, with the variable determining which item set it represents with its model.
[DISABLED] 693 - "SET BONUS: alien isolation xeno bonus pos" (alien_isolation_xeno_bonus_pos)	- I dunno if these do anything, or if they're just display-only text?

//--HIDDEN / UNDOCUMENTED ATTRIBUTES - Attributes that work, but never had any entries in items_game.txt--
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Below are undocumented Live TF2 attributes that mostly work, but for whatever reason never got any attribute entry in their entire history. Many are from scrapped item tests. This list is unordered and may be incomplete, and you'll also need to create your own attribute entries for these to function!]
[You can read more on these in this AlliedModders thread, https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=326853 - and also grab some sample entries in the .zip's config folder that can be put into a TF2C schema as-is. These are probably also in a few Custom Weapons packs, so keep your eyes open! I can't include attribute ID numbers for that reason.]

???? - "parachute disabled" (parachute_disabled)							- If present, disables you from using TF_Weapon_Parachute to, well, parachute. This obviously works best if on another one of your non-parachute weapons, to serve as a blocker for it.
???? - "fires milk bolt" (fires_milk_bolt) 									- For TF_Weapon_Crossbow, pressing alt-fire will fire your weapon with an additional milk-dousing ability to your shots. Input is amount of time in seconds before this alt-fire shot recharges!
[MvM] ???? - "force distribute currency on death" (force_distribute_currency_on_death)	- For Robots in MvM, if they have this attribute present, then their death will immediately give the credits to the killer, as it is with Sniper kills.
???? - "airblast dashes" (airblast_dashes) 									- When airblasting, you'll get a moderately strong forward-and-up push, that sends you in an arc forward from where you aim! However, you're unable to push enemies or deflect projectiles. You can combine with with "apply_self_knockback_airblast" for some interesting jumping behavior.
???? - "mod teleporter speed boost" (mod_teleporter_speed_boost) 			- On an Engineer's teleporters, after a player uses them to teleport, they also receive a speed buff for 4s!
???? - "can breathe under water" (can_breathe_under_water) 					- Lets you breathe underwater, so you don't start drowning when submerged. Doesn't work on triggers that force drowning damage anyway (though you have bigger problems there anyway)
???? - "cannot swim" (cannot_swim) 											- If enabled, your movement underwater is dramatically cut, if not almost completely removed. Your movement speed drops to about 18% of your normal move speed (extremely slow), and you sink like a rock, unable to move vertically unless you can walk to shore.
???? - "swimming mastery" (swimming_mastery) 								- If enabled, you move at full movement speed while underwater!
???? - "scoreboard minigame" (scoreboard_minigame) 							- This one's pretty funny - it affects your Scoreboard points. If you have an item with this, then every kill you score grants 1 extra point (usually 2 points per kill), but you'll also lose a whopping 3 points per death. Lock in, pal!
???? - "wet immunity" (wet_immunity) 										- You're unable to be afflicted with "wet" status effects like Jarate, Mad Milk, or Gas Passer soaking! Also seems to dramatically cut down time you spend wet after leaving water.
???? - "ability master sniper" (ability_master_sniper) 						- Point-based stat, goes up to at least "2". Works outside MvM! - Adds around 50% charge rate per point (35% for Huntsman) to your Sniper primary of choice. Pretty scary, but also simple. Surprised it wasn't kept in. May be related to the unused "arrow mastery" mentioned in MvM's popfiles.
???? - "last shot crits" (last_shot_crits) 									- For TF_Weapon_Revolver and TF2C_Weapon_Tranq, the last shot in your clip before reloading will always be a crit!
???? - "keep disguise on attack" (keep_disguise_on_attack) 					- You can attack while still disguised and not break disguise! Only for TF_Weapon_Revolver and TF2C_Weapon_Tranq, this isn't universal like before...
???? - "add give health to teammate on hit" (add_give_health_to_teammate_on_hit)	- On hitting a teammate with your melee, if they're injured you can heal them a variable amount of hp back at the cost of the same amount of your own! This is a really, really nice stat!
???? - "mod minigun can holster while spinning" (mod_minigun_can_holster_while_spinning)	- Lets you switch away from TF_Weapon_Minigun and TF2C_Weapon_AAGun while revved. Deceptively scary, plan ahead. However, doesn't let you switch while firing your weapon, wait for it to finish first!
???? - "kill combo fire rate boost" (kill_combo_fire_rate_boost) 			- This is VERY STRANGE! Basically, on kill, you get a input variable amount added to your firerate, say, 0.1 (10% faster). For every one of the same class you kill, your firerate increases again, up to 3 kills for a max of 3x your input (so, 30% faster). USE SMALL NUMBERS OR ELSE IT GETS INSANE IMMEDIATELY!! Fully resets on being resupplied, and resets to 1 kill on killing any other class (so you have a permanent firerate boost after the first kill)
???? - "mult dispenser rate" (mult_dispenser_rate) 							- On the Dispenser: Modifies how much more or less ammo people get each tick of standing next to it, and also how much less or more metal it regenerates per tick!
???? - "mvm sentry ammo" (mvm_sentry_ammo) 									- Visually and audibly, Sentry maxammo is still based on the original ammo capacity. More ammo won't visibly deplete until the original amount is left, and less ammo will show the bar start as being partly empty, or even make the HUD damaged noise if on low maxammo.
???? - "build small sentries" (build_small_sentries) 						- Turns your sentry into a micro-sentry! Oh, sorry, wrong script. Well, anyway, it makes your Sentry mini-sized, reduces its maxhealth by 33%, and requires 25% less metal to upgrade. Oh, right, you can upgrade it! Best used with other Sentry stats!
???? - "mult teleporter recharge rate" (mult_teleporter_recharge_rate)
???? - "disguise as dispenser on crouch" (disguise_as_dispenser_on_crouch) 	- Works! Kinda! As a Spy, if you have this on any weapon and you crouch, you play a few disguising effects and also move very slowly. To enemies, you appear as a Dispenser; on RED, you appear as a BLU Dispenser, and on every other team, you appear as a RED Dispenser. You get a small speed boost on un-crouching, too, just to help reposition!
???? - "ubercharge transfer" (ubercharge_transfer) 							- If you're using a TF_Weapon_SyringeGun with "ubercharge_ammo", add (or subtract) an input-percent of the Über you use per shot from the enemy Medic. This behaves extremely weirdly and can be hard to make numbers for. As an example, if you used 5 Übercharge to shoot the enemy Medic once, and wanted him to lose -10 Übercharge himself, you'd input something like -200 (I think).
???? - "teleport instead of die" (teleport_instead_of_die) 					- If you're going to take fatal damage and die, have a variable-percent chance (out of 1.0 for 100%) of instead immediately teleporting to your spawnroom with 1 health! Doesn't count as you dying for many purposes, like kill effects or VIP mode (!!!), but there's some rare cases where you don't get teleported back to spawn, usually if you take the fatal damage from falling or while airborne.
???? - "mod projectile heat seek power" (mod_projectile_heat_seek_power) 	- For flare-type projectiles, if shot toward an enemy that's on fire, it'll try to home in on them with variable strength. Higher numbers for faster homing! It's not super strong most of the time, so you'll still have to aim the flares mostly near the target for it to work. Behaves supremely weird with Scorch Shot flares.
???? - "mult dmg vs same class" (mult_dmg_vs_same_class)
???? - "uber on damage taken" (uber_on_damage_taken) 						- When you take damage, you have an input amount of chance to get a 3s Übercharge applied to you! It seems to be a general-purpose Über, so it won't interact with Medic's Mediguns or their Übercharge meters if you're a Medic or his patient at all.
???? - "mult dmgtaken from melee" (mult_dmgtaken_from_melee)
???? - "mult crit when health is below percent" (mult_crit_when_health_is_below_percent)	- Gain a free critboost when below a certain percent of health, up to 0.99. A value of 1 or higher doesn't seem to work, so no free crits by just existing!
???? - "penetration damage penalty" (penetration_damage_penalty) 			- For shots affected by "projectile_penetration", multiplies the damage done to subsequent enemies by an input value for each additional player hit. For instance, if you did 100 damage to enemy 1, with an input of 0.5, then you'll only do 50 to enemy 2, 25 to enemy 3, and so on. Yes, terrifyingly, it also works as a bonus.
???? - "firing forward pull" (firing_forward_pull) 							- W+M1, without the W. When holding M1 with a TF_Weapon_Flamethrower, you get pushed forward a variable amount of hU/s, and also get a speed boost that lasts until you let go. Doesn't work with negatives! It ain't S+M1!
???? - "mod soldier buff range" (mod_soldier_buff_range) 					- Affects the various Banner radial-buffs, no effect on Amputator's radial taunt or Civilian's radial-boost.
???? - "mult rocketjump deploy time" (mult_rocketjump_deploy_time)
???? - "aoe heal chance" (aoe_heal_chance) 									- On hitting an enemy, has a x/60 chance (times your weapon's fire-rate) to gain Amputator AoE radius-healing for 1s. 60 generally works to make this 100% on 1s firerate weapons, and 600 works for 0.1s firerate.
???? - "crits on damage" (crits_on_damage) 									- On hitting an enemy, has a x/60 chance (times your weapon's fire-rate) to gain a self-critboost for 3s.
???? - "stun on damage" (stun_on_damage) 									- On hitting an enemy, has a x/60 chance (times your weapon's fire-rate) to inflict stun on the enemy for 3s. Yikes.
???? - "aoe blast on damage" (aoe_blast_on_damage) 							- On hitting an enemy, has a x/60 chance (times your weapon's fire-rate) to inflict a 75-damage AoE around your target that stuns and inflicts bleed for 2s. Oh, also, the bleed also does 75 damage per tick (75 + 225 + your weapon's damage. Yiiiikesss.)
???? - "ubercharge ammo" (ubercharge_ammo) 									- For TF_Weapon_SyringeGun, uses a variable amount of Übercharge alongside your regular ammo per shot. Doesn't work with negatives... no adding über for you, sorry!
???? - "mul nonrocketjump attackrate" (mul_nonrocketjump_attackrate) 		- Yes, that is misspelled. This is actually a general purpose firerate attribute, and only has noticeable effects when you're blast jumping. If it's a concern, you can pair this with "rocketjump_attackrate_bonus" as well! Note: You can use this to change Minigun firerate without changing its pitch!
???? - "mult dmg with reduced health" (mult_dmg_with_reduced_health) 		- This works pretty much exactly like the Equalizer (the damaging one) - as your health goes down, your damage goes up to your input value. Also for fun, Equalizer ramps up to about 1.65x at lowest health!
???? - "mult airblast primary refire time" (mult_airblast_primary_refire_time)	- After airblasting, modifies the waiting time before you can use primary fire again. Sorta like an early Dragon's Fury airblast, but you can still spam airblast just as fast!
???? - "mod flamethrower spinup time" (mod_flamethrower_spinup_time) 		- Awkward, but sets the delay from pressing primary fire and having flames come out. Supposed to act like a Minigun's rev for gameplay, but 0 audio-visual feedback makes it just feel weird. Yes, not even having a Minigun model gives it any sound or movement.
???? - "mult airblast cone scale" (mult_airblast_cone_scale) 				- Somewhat modifies an airblast's horizontal range, but I'm not certain how. Use numbers between 0.1 and 5, I guess?
???? - "mult sniper charge per sec with enemy under crosshair" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec_with_enemy_under_crosshair)
???? - "sniper beep with enemy under crosshair" (sniper_beep_with_enemy_under_crosshair)	- On TF_Weapon_SniperRifle & variants (not TF2C_Weapon_Hunting_Revolver), when charging up damage, a little kiosk bell sound will play when an enemy is near your crosshair.

//--TF2C ADDITIONS - New attributes exclusive to TF2 Classified--
//---------------------------------------------------------------
//---------------------------------------------------------------

[v3.0.0]
5000 - "bomblets count mod mult hidden" (bomblets_count_mod)				- Modifier for how many Bomblets appear when a MIRV explodes! Multiplicative of the base amount (0.25 will create only one bomblet, and 10.0 will create 40 bomblets! - can also be used to spawn no bomblets at all)
[NON-FUNC] 5001 - "mirv drag mod mult hidden" (mirv_drag_mod)
5002 - "brick mini-crit long range" (mod_brick_minicrit_over_time)			- For brick-projectiles, lets them deal minicrit damage after a certain amount of time in the air, in seconds!
5003 - "rocket gravity" (mod_rocket_gravity)								- Your rockets sink like a rock, and how much they drop can be modified by input! Gravity projs will NOT get immediately removed touching a Skybox! Make sure they have enough grav to eventually drop down!
5004 - "no damage falloff over distance" (mod_no_dmg_falloff)				- These two disable damage falloff and rampup, respectively. Useful for controlling how you want damage to be done for weapons!
5005 - "no damage increase over distance" (mod_no_dmg_rampup)
5006 - "rocket whistle" (rocket_whistle)									- For gravity-rockets, causes them to also whistle as they fly! You can set a very very low grav if you wanna use this for straight-flying rockets.
5007 - "anchor earthquake" (earthquake_attack_active)						- When you take fall damage, emit a kinda shockwave that does damage! Can modify radial distance(?), base damage(??), and multiplier from fall damage. This was added as early as TF2C v2.1.0, but went through some changes since then, namely to give it more IMPACT!
5008 - "earthquake attack mins anchor" (earthquake_attack_mins_anchor)		- Minimum values for Earthquake attack's base damage and radial distance, respectively.
5009 - "take crits from projectile airborne" (take_crits_projectile_airborne)
5010 - "gravity mod active increased" (gravity_mod_active)					- While the weapon / item is equipped, "modifies" your active gravity - for higher or lower jumps, or faster / slower falling! DOES work with negative values for unconditional flight!!!!
5011 - "extra wearable bodygroup toggle active" (extra_wearable_bodygroup_toggle_active)	- This is interesting! Input is a string. For extra wearables, this toggles the input bodygroup on and off when you switch to it, if you have something like a visibly holstered weapon! So, you'd input "shield" to turn an extra wearable's matching "shield" bodygroup on and off, not nessecarily just removing it!
5012 - "teleporter is jump pad" (set_teleporter_mode)						- Changes Teleporters over for Jump pads, which can't be upgraded and have their own set of properties.
5013 - "mod horizontal spread" (mod_horizontal_spread)						- Changes pellet "spread" to a straight, horizontal line spreading out from your crosshair. Weird! Doesn't work on rapid-fire weapons.
5014 - "apply self knockback hidden" (apply_self_knockback)					- Knock yourself backwards with a certain velocity on firing. Works on most guns, also works with negative values to knock yourself forward. Also works with melees for the "hit" or impact part. 
5016 - "weapon enemy knockback mod mult hidden" (weapon_enemy_knockback_mod)	- Modifier for how powerful weapon knockback is! This affects BASE knockback and stacks with any further stuff, like via attrib. Note it won't be obvious when shooting targets since wep. knockback has lots of variation with angle, damage, "ground friction", and other bull.
5017 - "damage force reduction self launch" (damage_force_reduction_self_launch)	- Modifies air push force while you're already jumping via. non-blast self-knockback, like Twin-Barrel's knockback.
5018 - "heal on crit scythe simple" (heal_on_crit_scythe_simple)
5019 - "flat heal on afterburn on active" (flat_heal_on_afterburn_active)
5020 - "remember targets remaining afterburn" (remember_targets_afterburn)	- Very weird attrib. If the enemy dies with active afterburn, if you got some sort of effect from each afterburn tick (just heals atm), then that keeps happening even after they're dead, for the whole duration of the remaining afterburn!
5021 - "remove targets afterburn on death" (on_death_remove_targets_afterburn)	- If YOU die, any active afterburn you dealt to enemies is removed preemptively.
5022 - "bullet is a hull" (bullet_is_a_hull)								- Basically, makes your hitscan bullets fire out a variable-size "box-hull" I think - think of it like firing a really fast, invisible rocket that travels instantly from Point A to B. Var changes the size of the hull, cubed (2.0 makes a 2x2x2 box-hull!)
5023 - "explosive bullets" (explosive_bullets)								- Turns hitscan shots into "explosive hitscan" - an explosion will happen at the point of impact for each pellet! By default, explosive pellets don't have ANY splash radius, so you'll need to fix that. Since it's functionally 0, you need add it by making a new "mult_explosion_radius" attribute that's additive, not percentage (because anything times zero is still zero!)
5024 - "cannot use stored crits" (cannot_use_stored_crits)					- A weapon with this attrib can't normally make use of gain_stored_crits_on_hit's stored crits.
5025 - "gain stored crits on hit" (gain_stored_crits_on_hit)				- Gain 1 'stored crit' on a successful hit, up to about 3 total! Crits can be used either by the weapon itself (by default, if allowed) or any other weapon equipped. Lasts for a second or so for rapid-fire weapons!
5026 - "always crits on full stored crits" (always_crit_full_stored_crits)	- When at max stored crit capacity, you'll always do critical hits with this weapon. Best used with "lose_stored_crits_on_miss".
5027 - "lose stored crits on miss" (lose_stored_crits_on_miss)				- Depletes 1 stored Crit if you miss.
5028 - "melee taken becomes crit on wearer" (melee_taken_becomes_crit_wearer)	- Note that most classes will do 195 DMG on a crit-melee swing assuming no other modifiers. If you use it, expect the wielder to instantly die unless they're overhealed, a Heavy, or full-health Soldier
5029 - "move speed bonus while cloaked" (mult_player_movespeed_cloaked)
4030 - "lose cloak on damage" (lose_cloak_on_damage)						- THIS APPLIES TO SELF-DAMAGE OR HEALTH DRAIN TOO!!!
5031 - "mod min cloak to activate HIDDEN" (mod_min_cloak_to_activate)
5032 - "tranq on hit" (mod_tranq_onhit)										- Tranq. Enemies get slowed and slightly color blinded, among other things, for a variable amount of time.
5033 - "fishwhacker sweep" (deflect_on_smack_hit_player)					- Triggers an "airblast" effect on successfully hitting an enemy with a melee weapon, which knocks them back and deflects projectiles!
5034 - "mod_melee_dont_deflect_projectiles" (mod_melee_dont_deflect_projectiles)	- For "deflect_on_smack" and related, this forces it to not deflect projectiles, if you only wanted player knockback for instance.
5035 - "add condition on hit" (add_onhit_addcond)							- Adds an AddCond condition to the enemy when you hit 'em. Note; it'll escape onto your other weapons if you don't restrict it!
5036 - "add condition on hit self" (add_onhit_addcond_self)					- When you hit someone, add a condition onto yourself!
5037 - "add condition on hit weapon" (add_onhit_addcond_weapon)				- For addcond effects, only applies on the weapon itself that has said addcond effect! Should be default behavior tbh...
5038 - "add condition on hit self weapon" (add_onhit_addcond_self_weapon)
5039 - "rocket limited lifetime" (rocket_lifetime)							- Projectile has a limited range before it explodes. The value is in seconds traveled before it explodes.
5040 - "self knockback affected by damage boost modifier" (self_knockback_damage_boost_modifier)	- FOR "apply_self_knockback" AND VARIANTS ONLY - if you have a damage boost of some kind (civ boost, kritz), then scale your self-knockback accordingly. Very strong, but also very situational...
5041 - "apply self knockback" (apply_self_knockback)
5042 - "apply self knockback on swing" (apply_self_knockback_swing)			- Same as the other attrib, but for the first "swing" part of a Melee weapon. Much snappier!
5043 - "apply self knockback airblast" (apply_self_knockback_airblast)		- When airblasting, apply a variable self-knockback force to yourself, for "airblast jumps" or the like! Works like before, for TF_Weapon_Flamethrower and TF_Weapon_RocketLauncher_Fireball.
5044 - "proximity mines" (mod_sticky_is_proxy)								- Swaps Stickybomb behavior to Mine Layer's mines. Stickybombs bounce off walls, explode in close contact, and use the Mine Layer's proximity mine assets + sounds!
5045 - "sticky fizzles" (mod_sticky_fizzles)								- Trying to detonate stickies results in them harmlessly shattering! Also breaks the sticky into gibs if that's possible on the model, otherwise it just disappears in a quick flash.
5046 - "stickybomb charge rate mine layer" (stickybomb_charge_rate)
5047 - "blast splash damage decreased" (mult_explosion_splash_damage)		- ONLY affects splash damage - does absolutely nothing to impact / direct-hit damage. Sometimes useful for certain weapons which have odd or non-working splash damage numbers.
5048 - "custom hand viewmodel" (custom_hand_viewmodel)						- Override for your viewmodel arms themselves!! Enter a model path and it'll load it instead of the normal class arms. NOTE, this is affected by provide on active, so plan ahead!
5049 - "dmg push force to stickies increased" (mult_dmg_push_force_to_stickies)	- How much your explosives knock enemy Stickies around.
5050 - "mod coil max bounces" (mod_coil_max_bounces)						- Additive for amount of times coilgun lasers bounce! Works as you'd expect, value is how much more or less times it bounces. NOTE: Their damage is reduced more for every time they bounce before hitting a target, as before.
5051 - "umbrella recharge rate increased" (umbrella_recharge_rate)			- Modifies the boost recharge rate for TF2C_Weapon_Umbrella, with respect to the console variables. Took long enough! One note, though, is that it only seems to register if you switch weapons or respawn, if you're testing it out in real-time.
5052 - "civ boost cond override" (add_civ_boost_override)					- Override your boost's effect, follows the same rules as "add_onhit_addcond" for syntax, but where duration values are a percentage of the default Boost duration (A value of 2 means the cond lasts twice as long as a normal boost). Convoluted... but okay??
5053 - "mirv impact" (mirv_impact)											- If set, throwing a TF_Weapon_Grenade_MIRV's projectile will make it do damage if it hits someone before landing! Only applies to the main bomb (as far as I can tell)
5054 - "mult mirv impact damage" (mult_mirv_impact_damage)
[TEXT] 5055 - "anchor explain" (anchor_explain)								- Text-only: "Create earthquake upon taking fall damage while active"
[TEXT] 5056 - "harvester explain" (harvester_explain)						- Text-only: "Burning victims fill crit meter while active"
[TEXT] 5057 - "limited range" (limited_range)								- Text-only: "Weapon has limited range"
5058 - "flame_velocity_fade_start" (flame_gravity)
5059 - "flame_velocity_fade_end" (flame_gravity)
5060 - "add condition on kill" (add_onkill_addcond_self)					- Cond on self when you get a kill!
5061 - "gain stored crits on kill" (gain_stored_crits_on_kill)
5062 - "heal on kill on crit" (heal_on_kill_crit)							- Best used for melees with either very high random crit rates (higher than normal I mean), or guaranteed crits that trigger from stuff (a-la TF2C_Weapon_Scythe)
5063 - "instant reload on direct hit" (instant_reload_on_direct_hit)		- When hitting an enemy, "reloads" a variable amount of ammo into your active gun immediately with no delay. The text display for these attributes may look strange.
5064 - "instant reload on hit" (instant_reload_on_hit)
5065 - "instant reload on direct hit kill" (instant_reload_on_direct_hit_kill)
5066 - "instant reload on kill" (instant_reload_on_kill)
5067 - "custom view punch on hit" (add_custom_viewpunch_onhit)				- Apparently, it accepts a 6 value input, a min and max respectively for pitch, yaw, and roll, and it'll select randomly between those when applying viewpunch to enemies...?
5068 - "view punch on hit" (add_viewpunch_onhit)							- When hit, the victim of your attack's view gets thrown in a random, front-facing direction. Disorienting...
5069 - "less flinching when active" (mult_flinch_resist_active)				- For all 6 of these, modifies how much more or less you flinch (your screen jolting up) when taking damage. Values close to 0 mean no flinching. Can be negative for DOWNWARD flinching!! If you want that... for some reason.
5070 - "more flinching when active" (mult_flinch_resist_active)
5071 - "less flinching on wearer" (mult_flinch_resist_wearer)
5072 - "more flinching on wearer" (mult_flinch_resist_wearer)
5073 - "less flinching when aiming" (mult_flinch_resist_aiming)
5074 - "more flinching when aiming" (mult_flinch_resist_aiming)
5075 - "punch angle mod mult hidden" (punch_angle_mod)						- These seem to modify the "recoil" effect when shooting a gun - the screen-shake that happens when you fire something!
5076 - "punch angle mod add hidden" (punch_angle_mod)
5077 - "punch angle is constant" (punch_angle_is_constant)
5078 - "crit vs bleeding players" (crit_vs_bleeding_players)
5079 - "crits vs class" (crit_vs_class)										- FYI this is COMPLETELY unconditional, so use as a joke only sparingly (or not at all). Uses bitflags to determine what classes it works against...
5080 - "minicrits vs class" (minicrit_vs_class)
5081 - "crit vs player under feet" (crit_vs_player_under_feet)				- These SEEMS to only work if you're standing on their head - from my recent testing, most jumps won't do it. Standing on a higher surface and attacking ALSO doesn't do it (could be a prop, or even another player)
5082 - "minicrit vs player under feet" (minicrit_vs_player_under_feet)
5083 - "crit while disguised" (crit_while_disguised)						- Will work on the shot / swing that breaks disguise, too. Also works with "that" attribute, but just behave yourselves, okay? Yikes.
5084 - "crit take while disguised" (crit_take_while_disguised)				- Applies the ENTIRE time you're disguised, pretty steep downside unless you're pairing it with a pretty steep upside.
5085 - "minicrit while disguised" (minicrit_while_disguised)
5086 - "minicrit take while disguised" (minicrit_take_while_disguised)
5087 - "minicrit on objective" (mini_crit_on_objectives)					- While you or an enemy are "contributing" toward an Objective (Standing near a Control Point, Payload, or VIP, attacking an enemy VIP, or carrying Intel), you'll do (hidden) minicrits!
5088 - "crit vs cond no dot" (crit_vs_playercond)							- Crits vs. any addcond - input is the cond to check against (but add 1 to the result number)! Also isn't affected by any Damage-over-Time effects (like afterburn or bleed). Useful.
5089 - "minicrit vs cond no dot" (minicrit_vs_playercond)
5090 - "mult dmg crit multiplier" (mult_dmg_crit_multiplier)				- Modifier for how much damage a critical hit does! This is a multiplier on-top of the existing one for crits (which is about 3.00), so something like 0.333 is about 1x damage. Can be useful to fix minor rounding errors!
5091 - "headshot is minicrit" (headshot_is_minicrit)						- Turns headshot crits into minicrits, simple enough! Works for basically anything that can headshot, but NOT for any sort of projectile arrows! Be mindful that minicrits suffer damage falloff, so plan accordingly.
5092 - "lifesteal" (lifesteal)												- Slightly different than the Kunai - this heals you for any damage you do, period! Heals are 1-1 to damage, but it can't overheal. It's also general, so it works on guns (it is VERY overpowered on those though, use wisely please)
5093 - "lifesteal crit" (lifesteal_crit)
5094 - "buildings max level penalty" (add_buildings_max_level)				- Minimum is Lvl 1, and maximum is Lvl 3.
5095 - "buildings upgrade cost bonus" (add_buildings_upgrade_cost)			- Add or reduce the amount of Metal needed to upgrade a building to the next level. Lower bound is 0 (can upgrade a building by hitting it)
5096 - "building add condition on death" (building_maxlvl_lost_addcond)		- When an enemy destroys a Lvl. 3 building of yours, apply a cond to yourself!
5097 - "engineer dispenser build rate multiplier" (dispenser_build_rate_multiplier)
5098 - "engineer jumppad build rate multiplier" (jumppad_build_rate_multiplier)
5099 - "mod dispenser cost" (mod_dispenser_cost)							- Independent modifiers for Building Costs! Teleporter already has one grandfathered in, so these are for all the remaining buildings.
5100 - "mod sentrygun cost" (mod_sentrygun_cost)
5101 - "mod jumppad cost" (mod_jumppad_cost)
5102 - "no primary ammo from dispensers" (no_primary_ammo_from_dispensers_always)
5103 - "sentry hit chance when shield charging mult" (sentry_hit_chance_shield_charge)	- I guess a percent chance for sentrygun fire to miss when it would normally hit if you're charging with the cond.. this is kinda weird?
5104 - "return metal on sentry kill" (metal_on_sentry_kill)					- When your Sentry gets any kind of kill, gives you back a variable amount of Metal.
5105 - "engy sentry knockback bonus" (mult_sentry_knockback)				- Works about how you expect, can also do negative knockback numbers if you're a sadist
5106 - "engy sentry knockback penalty" (mult_sentry_knockback)
5107 - "engy sentry turn rate bonus" (mult_sentry_turnrate)					- Adjusts your Sentry's turn-rate globally - the speed at which it turns toward targets, that is!
5108 - "engy sentry turn rate penalty" (mult_sentry_turnrate)
5109 - "medigun healing received bonus" (mult_medigun_healing_received)
5110 - "medigun healing received penalty" (mult_medigun_healing_received)
5111 - "medigun healing received on active bonus" (mult_medigun_healing_received_active)
5112 - "medigun healing received on active penalty" (mult_medigun_healing_received_active)
5113 - "dispenser healing received bonus" (mult_dispenser_healing_received)
5114 - "dispenser healing received penalty" (mult_dispenser_healing_received)
5115 - "dispenser healing received on active bonus" (mult_dispenser_healing_received_active)
5116 - "dispenser healing received on active penalty" (mult_dispenser_healing_received_active)
5117 - "dispenser can overheal on wearer" (dispenser_can_overheal_wearer)	- Very neat, but should be used sparingly since it's basically free overheal as long as a Dispenser exists.
5118 - "dispenser can overheal on active" (dispenser_can_overheal_active)
5119 - "everything can overheal on wearer" (everything_can_overheal_wearer)	- Includes: Medics, Dispensers (+ Payload), negative dmg trigger_hurt! Possibly more, idk.
5120 - "everything can overheal on active" (everything_can_overheal_active)
5121 - "no crit heals" (crit_heals_disabled)								- Being Critboosted or Minicritboosted doesn't affect your healing output or über gain.
5122 - "health kits can overheal on wearer" (health_kits_can_overheal_wearer)	- As it says. It SHOULD be noted that you can pick up any healthkits so long as you aren't at full Overheal (always). Use responsibly...
5123 - "health kits can overheal on active" (health_kits_can_overheal_active)
5124 - "healing received on active bonus" (mult_healing_received_active)
5125 - "healing received on active penalty" (mult_healing_received_active)
5126 - "health from packs increased on active" (mult_health_frompacks_active)
5127 - "health from packs decreased on active" (mult_health_frompacks_active)
5128 - "health regen delay time when damaged" (mod_health_regen_hurt_delay)	- I think this modifies the time in seconds before your passive HP regen kicks in after taking any damage
5129 - "mod burstfire" (mod_burstfire)										- On most weapons, switches it over to a "burst-fire" mode! Accepts 2 inputs; how many shots in a burst, and the firing bonus to apply to your regular firerate while burstfiring! "3 0.33" will make it shoot 3 shots, all 66% faster! Note: You can use this to change Minigun firerate without changing its pitch!
5130 - "mult proxymine radius" (mult_proxymine_radius)
5131 - "charge weapon no extra speed" (chargeweapon_no_extra_speed)			- Only appears to work for TF_Weapon_Grenade_MIRV and TF2C_Weapon_Coilgun - charging up your weapon doesn't give your projectile any extra speed. Other weapon types unaffected...
5132 - "cyclops detonate other grenades" (cyclops_detonate_other_grenades)	- Sadly only works for pipe-bombs emitted by TF2C_Weapon_Cyclops; owned Stickybombs, MIRVs, and MIRV bomblets will detonate prematurely regardless of their original timer, and enemy stickybombs get destroyed!
[TEXT] 5133 - "cyclops explain"												- Text-only: "Holding down fire key prevents detonation"
5134 - "rocket jump damage reduction weapon" (rocket_jump_dmg_reduction_weapon)
5135 - "hidden separator" (hidden_separator)								- An INTERESTING one!! This is a meta-attribute, it'll HIDE all attributes that show up beneath it, generally in order. Useful for if you wanna hide lots of stats and / or don't wanna wrangle with making new ones for all of 'em. Do note, if it appears in a static_attrs section, it'll hide anything in the attributes section, even if it's above it in the entry. The reverse is true as well.
5136 - "Projectile speed secondary" (mult_projectile_speed_secondary)		- This seems to modify the speed of the Über Generator fired by TF2C_Weapon_HealLauncher?
5137 - "custom falloff" (mod_custom_falloff)								- Set a new multiplier value to use for Falloff! Most weapons use 0.5 at a distance. Unlike rampup, this seems EXTREMELY inconsistent between weapons, sometimes it works as intended, or only works on the last killing shot, or refuses to work at all. Supplant with "mod_no_dmg_falloff" or "mult_falloff_distance", if needed.
5138 - "custom rampup" (mod_custom_rampup)									- Set a new multiplier value to use for Rampup! Most weapons use 1.5 up close, Scout primaries / beefy hitscan use 1.75, Rockets use 1.25, other projectiles usually use 1.2. Otherwise, Pipes / Flares / Sniper Rifles usually just use 1.0. Can be set below 1.0 for decreased damage close up (aka inverted rampup)
5139 - "longer damage falloff distance" (mult_falloff_distance)				- Changes falloff distance! Higher than 1 means further away, lower means closer. Useful with some of the existing rampup / falloff attributes! Also useful for if you're only flying half a ship (looking at you, broken mod_custom_falloff)
5140 - "shorter damage falloff distance" (mult_falloff_distance)
5141 - "particle on melee hit" (particle_on_melee_hit)						- Spawns another particle on top of the existing hit particle for the melee weapon. Doesn't work for TF_Weapon_Bottle and similar.
5142 - "mod lunchbox critboostable" (mod_lunchbox_critboostable)			- Crit food!! If you consume a lunchbox item while under the influence of a critboost, it heals 3x as much (which usually overheals), and also acts as a full health kit no matter what when thrown.
5143 - "mod crit airborne simple" (crit_airborne_simple)					- No blast-jumping involved, if somebody's in the air at all, deal (mini) crits against 'em. Must be used with "(mini)crit_airborne_simple_min_height"
5144 - "mod crit airborne simple min height" (crit_airborne_simple_min_height)	- For "(mini)crit_airborne_simple", sets how high somebody has to be above a surface in hU's before you're allowed to start dealing extra damage vs. them. Most regular jumps are 50-70 hU's off the ground.
5145 - "modifier crit airborne direct hit only" (mod_crit_airborne_direct_hit_only)	- For "crit_airborne" and variants, modifies it so you can only deal extra damage with direct hits! Only for explosives, naturally.
5146 - "crit on objective" (crit_on_objectives)								- Similar to "mini_crit_on_objectives", but a bit more conditional! When you or the enemy are near major objectives (Control Points, Payloads, or carrying Intel), deal crits! Notably, this won't do any extra damage to VIPs or people within their defensive aura.
[NEED_FIXES] 5147 - "add ammo on direct hit" (add_ammo_on_direct_hit)		- THESE TWO ONLY WORK FOR EXPLOSIVES RIGHT NOW! No matching attribute for generic hits. When hitting an enemy, adds a variable amount of ammo into your active weapon's reserve, if it has one. Legacy TF2C also had a variant for indirect damage hits, too, for splash damage, but this is all good!
5148 - "add ammo on direct hit kill" (add_ammo_on_direct_hit_kill)
5149 - "add ammo on kill" (add_ammo_on_kill)
5150 - "mult taser heal scale" (mult_taser_heal_scale)						- MODIFIER FOR TF_WEAPON_TASER HEALING!! Modifies the percentage of health the patient is healed by on a successful hit - ideally, lower, since by default it fully overheals a patient.
	[...Broken text for "minicrit vs wet players" (minicrit_vs_wet_players) is also here]
5151 - "mod taser damage noscale" (mod_taser_damage_noscale)				- As above. Your melee damage is no longer affected by your current charge. This still depletes your charge on hit, though.
	[...Broken text for "take minicrits projectile airborne" (take_minicrits_projectile_airborne) is also here. This stat doesn't otherwise exist in the schema.]
[TEXT] 5152 - "heal on smack DISPLAY ONLY" (heal_on_smack_DISPLAY_ONLY)		- Text-only: "Hit teammates at maximum charge to fully heal them"
5153 - "minicrit vs wet players" (minicrit_vs_wet_players)
	[...Broken text for "mult dmg crit" (mult_dmg_crit) is also here]
5154 - "set watch panel" (set_watch_panel)									- Watch VGUI panel modifier! It's just a toggle for now - 1 sets it to a circular-shaped meter (this decrements in notches instead of continuously)
5155 - "no centerfire projectile" (no_centerfire_projectile)				- Forces this weapon to never centerfire, even when "tf2c_centerfire_preference" is set to 1.
5156 - "drop team health pack on kill" (drop_team_health_pack_on_kill)		- Similar to "drop_health_pack_on_kill", enemies drop a small healthpack on kill. However! It's a team-only healthpack, so enemies can't use it to heal off their wounds!
[NON-FUNC] 5157 - "passive reload holstered" (passive_reload_holstered)		- If this works, I can't figure out how to get it to work, or what it works on.
5158 - "heal on crit scythe simple taunt" (heal_on_crit_scythe_simple_taunt)
5159 - "mod taunt kill fill stored crits" (mod_taunt_kill_fill_stored_crits)

5177 - "uber duration decreased" (add_uber_time_active)
5178 - "self damage penetrates uber" (mod_self_damage_penetrates_uber)		- Any self-damage done to yourself (usually explosions) will damage you even through an active Übercharge.
5179 - "mod allow self dmg dot weapon" (mod_allow_self_dmg_dot_weapon)		- If dealing damage to yourself (like via hit_self_on_miss, or with explosives), allows this to inflict any of its on-hit statuses to yourself, too!
5180 - "dmg taken from fall reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fall)				- Oof owie my bones
5181 - "dmg taken from fall increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fall)
5182 - "dmg taken from burning target reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_burning_target_wearer)	- If an enemy is actively on fire, take more or less damage from them yourself.
5183 - "dmg taken from burning target reduced on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_burning_target_active)
5184 - "dmg taken from blast direct reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_direct)
5185 - "dmg taken from blast direct increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_direct)
5186 - "dmg taken from blast splash reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_splash)
5187 - "dmg taken from blast splash increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_splash)
5188 - "dmg taken from blast direct reduced on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_direct_active)
5189 - "dmg taken from blast direct increased on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_direct_active)
5190 - "dmg taken from blast splash reduced on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_splash_active)
5191 - "dmg taken from blast splash increased on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions_splash_active)
5192 - "not crit vs burning flare" (not_crit_vs_burning_flare)				- Flares projectiles shot by your weapon don't crit burning targets! Finally.
5193 - "scoped firerate penalty" (mult_postfiredelay_scoped)				- Fire rate stuff that works on scoped shots! Completely independent of the normal Fire Rate modifiers. With low-enough fire rates (about 0.33 works), then you can fire fast enough to not unscope between shots!
5194 - "hide ammo hud" (hide_ammo_hud)										- Hides your ammo display if your weapon has one. Best used where ammo management isn't really a problem!
5195 - "minigun deployed crouchwalk" (minigun_deployed_crouchwalk)			- You can crouchwalk while a Minigun or AAGun is deployed! As it is, just defaults to the regular un-revved crouchwalk anims for it (which work surprisingly well!). Not terribly useful since you move ungodly slow, but it helps a bit.
5196 - "minigun jump while revved" (minigun_jump_while_revved)				- You can jump while a Minigun or AAGun is deployed! There's no special / working animation for it, or being airborne with a Minigun, but it's the thought that counts. Use this wisely, since a smart Heavy can use this to effectively negate his move speed penalties!!
5197 - "custom projectile origin offset" (custom_projectile_origin_offset)	- Change the xyz spawning origin of your projectiles manually, relative to your player origin. In layman's terms; how far away (x), how much to the side (y), how much up / down (z), The attribute entry lists some numbers for base projectiles... Also, I'm unsure how it displays to other clients. Hmm.
5198 - "can headshot" (can_headshot)										- On most hitscan weapons, if your damage lands in the head hitbox - whatever hit there crits! No need to scope to deal crit damage. Does NOT work for melees or any projectiles. Also doesn't work for explosive hitscan...
5199 - "banned in medieval mode" (banned_in_medieval_mode)					- Generally only effective for Melee weapons! If you can't equip a certain Melee while in Medieval, then it strips the slot and you run around uselessly in an A-pose. Civilian gaming!
5200 - "no explosion falloff hidden" (disable_explosion_falloff)
5201 - "custom disguise sound" (custom_disguise_sound)						- Custom sound when disguising! Accepts any old soundscript.
5202 - "mult disguise speed penalty" (mult_disguise_speed)
5203 - "mult disguise speed bonus" (mult_disguise_speed)
5204 - "lose cloak on decloak" (lose_cloak_on_decloak)						- Lose a variable amount of cloak when you decloak prematurely, up to 10
5205 - "shield bash aoe knockback" (add_shield_bash_aoe_knockback)			- On a shield-bash against any surface or player, applies a little bit of AoE pushback to enemies in a variable radius you can set! I believe the input is in hU's?
5206 - "mod zoomed dont hide viewmodel" (mod_zoomed_dont_hide_viewmodel)	- Best used for stuff without a Scope, looks weird but works otherwise!
5207 - "cannot pickup dropped weapons while cloaked" (cannot_pickup_dropped_weapons_while_cloaked)	- Similar to "NoCloakWhenCloaked", but more flexible. Input is the max cloak meter you can have before being disallowed from picking up weapons. 0.75 means you can refill at any point up to 3/4ths, before being stopped. 0.1 means you can only pick up cloak when nearly empty.
5208 - "primary ammo from ammo packs bonus" (mult_primary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
5209 - "primary ammo from ammo packs penalty" (mult_primary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
5210 - "primary ammo from dropped weapons bonus" (mult_primary_ammo_from_dropped_weapons)
5211 - "primary ammo from dropped weapons penalty" (mult_primary_ammo_from_dropped_weapons)
5212 - "secondary ammo from ammo packs bonus" (mult_secondary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
5213 - "secondary ammo from ammo packs penalty" (mult_secondary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
5214 - "secondary ammo from dropped weapons bonus" (mult_secondary_ammo_from_dropped_weapons)
5215 - "secondary ammo from dropped weapons penalty" (mult_secondary_ammo_from_dropped_weapons)
5216 - "mod deflect no minicrit" (mod_deflect_no_minicrit)
5217 - "airblast deflect disabled" (airblast_deflect_disabled)				- Similar enough to "airblast_deflect_projectiles_disabled".
5218 - "maxammo grenades2 increased" (mult_maxammo_grenades2)				- Theoretically modifies your Grenades2 ammo, but nothing uses it yet, so this is hard to check...
5220 - "airblast extinguish disabled" (airblast_extinguish_disabled)		- Similar enough to "airblast_put_out_teammate_disabled".
5221 - "custom lunchbox throwable type" (custom_lunchbox_throwable_type)	- Set what kind of health kit a throwable Sandvich emits! 1, 2, and 3 are small, medium (default), and large, respectively! If you don't set this at all, it defaults to medium health kit
5222 - "custom lunchbox throwable model" (custom_lunchbox_throwable_model)	- CUSTOM MODEL OVERRIDE FOR SANDVICHES!! Took long enough... HOWEVER, Lunchbox Throwables aren't teamcolored yet!
5223 - "mult lunchbox throwable velocity" (mult_lunchbox_throwable_velocity)
5224 - "lunchbox add condition on eat" (lunchbox_addcond)					- FINALLY, LUNCHBOX ADDCONDS! Important note; the healing from Sandvich-based stuff DOES cancel medigun über / kritz conds - so you have to use unconditional crits / übers if you want them to not wear off immediately. Also, nothing stops you from sitting and spamming it. Fair warning...
5225 - "mod spread scale scoped override" (mod_spread_scale_scoped_override)
[NEED_FEATURES] 5226 - "mod sniper zoom while jumping" (mod_sniper_zoom_while_jumping)	- You can jump while scoped in with TF_Weapon_SniperRifle and variants! Nothing to say, it just feels right. Doesn't work on TF2C_Weapon_Hunting_Revolver or TF_Weapon_Compound_Bow
5227 - "mod sniper crit after zoom time" (mod_sniper_crit_after_zoom_time)	- Time in seconds before Sniper is able to deal crit headshots to enemies after zooming in! By default, Sniper can do that instantly, so this is mainly to nerf it. Try 0.2s!
5228 - "mod ammo per reload" (mod_ammo_per_reload)							- Additive modifier for how much ammo is reloaded per reloading action - if you set it to 1, that means 1 additional ammo is loaded and decremented whenever you do a reloading action (for multi reloads)
5229 - "set reload single" (set_reload_single)								- For weapons that reload their entire clip at once, makes them reload the way Shotguns do, in increments.
5230 - "Reload time start" (mult_reload_time_start)							- This is to set various reload time values that are otherwise missing, usually for turning single reloads into multi reloads. You'll NEED these!
5231 - "Reload time refill" (mult_reload_time_refill)
[NON-FUNC] 5232 - "proj detonate with rocket radius" (proj_detonate_with_rocket_radius)	- A VERY weird one. If you throw a MIRV, then it'll detonate when you shoot a rocket projectile at it??? Var defines the radius for the rocket to show up to explode. Also works for Pipebombs and Bricks! However, it'll only work for your own projectiles. Enemies shooting at it with their own rockets can't trigger it.
5233 - "deflect on swing" (deflect_on_swing)								- When swinging with your Melee, push enemies + projectiles back just like an Airblast!
5234 - "deflect on smack hidden" (deflect_on_smack)							- Same as above, but for the "hit" portion of your melee attack.
5235 - "add condition on swing" (add_onswing_addcond)						- Add a cond to yourself on swinging a Melee weapon. Doesn't work on guns!
5236 - "add condition on miss" (onmiss_addcond)
5237 - "mult melee smack delay" (mult_melee_smack_delay)					- General modifier! Modifies the delay between swinging a melee weapon and actually hitting something. Works to make it shorter as-is. Lengthening the time is buggy, you'll have to make it an additive to have that work! (for all melees; also includes Spy Knife). Use an additive value of 0.2 for Spy knives
5238 - "mod melee crit swing custom damage" (mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage)	- KILL EFFECTS!! When you get a critical kill with a melee weapon, you can apply some kind of effect to it. Not bitflags, but I've provided a short list in the bitflags section!
5239 - "mod melee swing custom damage" (mod_melee_swing_custom_damage)		- General-purpose melee kill effects! The same general deal as "mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage" - getting a kill with a melee weapon applies some sort of event effect! NOTE: THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT OF THE BOX WITH CRIT-KILLS!! Use the other attrib for that.
5240 - "brick explodes" (brick_explode)										- For TF2C_Weapon_Brick's projectile, instead of disappearing into thin air, they detonate like a regular pipe bomb! They still have no visual timer for such, though. Also, FYI, default fuse time for Bricks seems to be 10s flat, if you need to modify it!

???? - "take minicrits projectile airborne" (take_minicrits_projectile_airborne)													
???? - "gravity mod wearer increased" (gravity_mod_wearer)					- While the weapon / item is equipped, "modifies" your active gravity - for higher or lower jumps, or faster / slower falling! DOES work with negative values for unconditional flight!!!!
???? - "gravity mod wearer reduced" (gravity_mod_wearer)
???? - "???" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fall_active)
???? - "???" (lunchbox_force_cooldown)										- For Lunchbox items, forces them to be used up after consumption.

//----------------------------------------------------
//----------------------------------------------------

0 - "Aiming / Revved" (TF_COND_AIMING) 								- "Aiming" cond used by Miniguns / S. Rifles. It'll usually just change your animation state to "ACT_MP_DEPLOYED", and has no effect on speed by itself most of the time.
1 - "Scoped-In" (TF_COND_ZOOMED) 									- Scope overlay for S. Rifles. Adds the weird, fake scope overlay, which goes away when you do most actions. No other effect on non-Sniper Rifle.
3 - "Disguised" (TF_COND_DISGUISED) 								- Disguised. Seems to (kinda) work on all classes. It goes by your last stored disguise - if you don't have one, it's buggy. It works kinda-fine on Spy, but FYI, it doesn't work if added via attribute.
4 - "Cloak" (TF_COND_STEALTHED) 								- [Cloak]. Makes you invisible, can't attack. If you're on Spy, then do all the usual stuff. Otherwise, on non-Spy, the cloak just disappears instantly!
5 - "Medigun: Übercharge" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE)				- [Medigun: Übercharge]. It's the Übercharge, make yourself invincible! --- IMPORTANT NOTE; Medigun Über conds will WEAR OFF when you encounter any sort of healing! If you want it to last, use another cond!
6 - "Just Teleported" (TF_COND_TELEPORTED) 						- [Teleporter Dust]. Used when you teleport, spawns some cute little dust particles around your feet for a time!
8 - "Über: Wearing Off" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_WEARINGOFF) 			- Über Wearing-off flash. If you have an active Invuln Über, adding this will make you flash as if you're about to lose it. It'll stay until either this or the Über ends.
10 - "Teleporting" (TF_COND_SELECTED_TO_TELEPORT)					- Teleporting helper! Doesn't do much, but among other things, you can't pick up flags.
11 - "Medigun: Kritz" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED)						- [Medigun: Critboost], does what it says on the tin; provides a kritz crit-boost! --- IMPORTANT NOTE; Medigun Über conds will WEAR OFF when you encounter any sort of healing! If you want it to last, use another cond!
13 - "Cloak: DR Buff" (TF_COND_FEIGN_DEATH)						- [Cloak: Spd + Res] just adds a normal speed-boost for non-Spy, and for Spy, it makes you cloak with a a defensive buff!
14 - "Bonk Invuln" (TF_COND_PHASE)									- Bonk Invuln! Only seems to do anything on Scout - become invincible, have speed-blurs show up, and get a slowdown effect if you took damage. The works.
16 - "Minicrits: Banner" (TF_COND_OFFENSEBUFF)					- [Minicrits] buff! Not too much to say, used by Buff Banner, and it'll do 35% extra damage while the duration lasts. Super handy. This is a good general-purpose one.
17 - "Charging" (TF_COND_SHIELD_CHARGE)								- Shield Charge. On Demoman, just does the usual shield-charge stuff - high speed, low turning, lots of screaming. On non-Demo, it only maxes out at that class' move speed...
19 - "Minicrits: Weapon" (TF_COND_ENERGY_BUFF)					- [Minicrits: Wpn] gets added to various weapons for their temporary minicrits. Do note a few attributes check against this, both on the user and as a foe.
20 - "Amputator Aura" (TF_COND_RADIUSHEAL)							- Amputator heal-rings. This is visual-only, when you taunt, some teamcolored rings appear beneath you, but that's about it.
21 - "Healing" (TF_COND_HEALTH_BUFF)								- Medigun healing helper. Doesn't do anything via. addcond, but often gets added when you're being healed by most healbeams. Can check against this for other conds, hehe...
22 - "Burning" (TF_COND_BURNING)									- Burning helper. Doesn't apply afterburn via. addcond, and just makes the class scream about it. Gets removed by what you'd expect. Probably needs some extra info to work (ie: Burn damage? Burn time? Who dealt it?)
24 - "Jarate'd" (TF_COND_URINE)									- [Jarate]-sodden. Yuck. Covers your model and screen, and players affected take 35% extra damage! Very vulnerable to many weapons, and gets removed faster if healed.
25 - "Bleeding" (TF_COND_BLEEDING)									- Bleeding helper. It does exactly nothing on its own via addcond, but gets added for various on-hit bleeding effects.

26 - "Def. Buff: Banner" (TF_COND_DEFENSEBUFF) 					- [Def. Buff] from the Battalion's Backup! Grants a 35% damage resistance (and more to Sentries), all-around handy.
27 - "Mad Milk'd" (TF_COND_MAD_MILK) 							- [Mad Milk]-sodden. Yikes. Enemies targeting a milk-sodden player gain 60% damage done as health by shooting 'em. Has an icon on the HUD.
28 - "Medigun: Megaheal" (TF_COND_MEGAHEAL)							- [Medigun: Megaheal] helper, doesn't do much sadly, spawns a few aura particles. BUT, it will block stuns and prevent any non-self-knockback! So, still useful!
29 - "Lifesteal: Banner" (TF_COND_REGENONDAMAGEBUFF) 			- [Health-on-hit] from Concheror. Gain 35% of the damage you deal to any enemy back as health! Also comes with the usual glowy-bits and UI elements.
30 - "Marked for Death" (TF_COND_MARKEDFORDEATH) 				- [Mark for Death] - inflict a debuff that makes enemies take minicrit damage (35% more!). Also plays the sound and shows an icon!
31 - "Minicrits: Hidden" (TF_COND_NOHEALINGDAMAGEBUFF) 				- [Minicrits: No Heals] - a very weird slant on the minicrits conds. Not only are there seemingly no visuals to it (beside buff-rings), but you're also unable to recieve healing while it's active. Ride or die!
32 - "Speed Boosted" (TF_COND_SPEED_BOOST) 						- [Speed-boost]! You run faster while active, that's it. Comes with a little boost sound and some faint particles!
33 - "Crits: Pumpkin" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_PUMPKIN) 			- [Critboost], but generic this time! This, as well as the next 6 critboosts, are (mostly) just unconditional crits with the effects and all. Very useful.
34 - "Crits: Canteen" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_USER_BUFF)			- [Critboost: Canteen], same as usual but also doubles your Sentry Gun's firing speed, too!
35 - "Crits: Charging" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_DEMO_CHARGE)			- Shield critboost. Unlike the others, this comes with different sfx, and, importantly, does NOT provide crits to guns. Only melee-weapons. That sucks.
36 - "Hype Boost" (TF_COND_SODAPOPPER_HYPE) 						- Hype boost. This effect changed a lot, but currently only works with TF_Weapon_Soda_Popper to enable multi-jumps for the duration. No effect otherwise.
37 - "Crits: First Blood" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_FIRST_BLOOD)
38 - "Crits: Round Win" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_BONUS_TIME)
39 - "Crits: Flag Cap" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_CTF_CAPTURE)
40 - "Crits: Kill" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_ON_KILL)
41 - "Melee Only" (TF_COND_CANNOT_SWITCH_FROM_MELEE) 				- [Melee-only]. Works a little counter-intuitively, you can't switch away from Melee weapons only if you happen to be use one while this cond is active. It doesn't force you off your other weapons by itself! Can be useful if you work it properly.
42 - "Def. Buff: MvM" (TF_COND_DEFENSEBUFF_NO_CRIT_BLOCK) 			- [Def. Buff: MvM] works basically the same as the regular one, but without the HUD icon and without any crit-resistance, apparently. Slightly weaker, if you need that for your items.
44 - "Crits: Mmmph" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_RAGE_BUFF) 			- [Critboost: Primary] - this one's pretty strange, when added, it gives you a critboost that ONLY applies to your current Primary weapon, and nothing else. Used by the Phlog, but surprisingly useful elsewhere!
45 - "Def. Buff: Mmmph" (TF_COND_DEFENSEBUFF_HIGH) 				- [Super Def. Buff]. This one's ridiculous. It adds a whopping 75% DAMAGE RESISTANCE to you for the duration, with effects!! Holy hell!?
46 - "Sniper Focus" (TF_COND_SNIPERCHARGE_RAGE_BUFF) 			- [Focus effect] for Sniper Primaries - you won't need to unscope to fire more shots while this cond is going. On every other weapon, just provides crit-spark visuals and sounds, which might be cool visuals for some other active property.
48 - "MfD: Silent" (TF_COND_MARKEDFORDEATH_SILENT) 					- Marked for Death, but silent this time. I'm not entirely sure everything this does, but it doesn't play a sound when inflicted with it, and displays a different icon.
49 - "Dispenserized" (TF_COND_DISGUISED_AS_DISPENSER) 				- Dispenser disguise! When active and you're crouched, enemy players will see you as a dispenser on the "opposite team" - though this falls apart a bit in 4Team. It also raises your speed alarmingly high while active!?
50 - "MvM Sapped" (TF_COND_SAPPED) 									- MvM Sapped fx - applies a little spark particle effect to the head of most classes. Allegedly, this will - in MvM only - also allow you to stab an affected player (or, bot) from any angle unless they're a giant robot. No such fun in normal gamemodes, though.

51 - "Über: Hidden" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_HIDE_UNLESS_DAMAGED) 	- [Über: Hidden]! Visually, you don't look übered at all, but you are, and taking any damage will instantly show you as übered for 2s. Lasts as long as the cond does!
52 - "Über: Canteen" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_USER_BUFF) 			- [Über], but generic this time! It also reduces damage your Sentry Guns take, if you own one. Altogether, not a bad option for a generic invuln effect.
54 - "HWN: Thriller" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_THRILLER) 					- HWN: Thriller doesn't do too much without its map-scripting - it just locks you in place and plays some SPOOKY thriller music! You can't do ANYTHING at all until the condition ends.
55 - "Radius Healing" (TF_COND_RADIUSHEAL_ON_DAMAGE) 			- [Radius Healing] THAT WORKS!! This can be used as a generic version in lieu of Amputator's taunt effect. It'll add those conds and heal teammates until either the cond runs out, or a taunt of yours ends, whichever happens first.
56 - "Crits: Spell" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_CARD_EFFECT)
57 - "Über: Spell" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_CARD_EFFECT)				- This is ANOTHER generic Über, if you wanted that instead! This has no other effects attached, so use this for a close-to-stock version!
58 - "Medigun: Bullet Uber" (TF_COND_MEDIGUN_UBER_BULLET_RESIST) 	- Medigun: Über Resistances. These sadly don't really work outside of the Vaccinator, they provide exactly 0% resistance.
59 - "Medigun: Blast Uber" (TF_COND_MEDIGUN_UBER_BLAST_RESIST)
60 - "Medigun: Fire Uber" (TF_COND_MEDIGUN_UBER_FIRE_RESIST)
61 - "Medigun: Bullet Res" (TF_COND_MEDIGUN_SMALL_BULLET_RESIST) 	- Medigun: Passive Resistances. These sadly don't really work outside of the Vaccinator, they provide exactly 0% resistance.
62 - "Medigun: Blast Res" (TF_COND_MEDIGUN_SMALL_BLAST_RESIST)
63 - "Medigun: Fire Res" (TF_COND_MEDIGUN_SMALL_FIRE_RESIST)
64 - "Stealthed" (TF_COND_STEALTHED_USER_BUFF) 						- Stealthed; like a normal Cloak, but you can attack! You'll decloak immediately if you do attack, but with no noise. If it runs out naturally, you decloak instantly, with absolutely no sound, animation, or warning. Jumpscare to both you and the enemy!
66 - "Stealthed: Fading" (TF_COND_STEALTHED_USER_BUFF_FADING) 	- [Stealthed], but you'll recloak immediately after attacking! Most of the same properties of the previous one apply, but use this if you want it to be a continuous effect.
67 - "Bullet Immunity" (TF_COND_BULLET_IMMUNE) 					- [Immune to Bullets], and other stuff that uses the damage type [DMG_BULLET, DMG_BUCKSHOT].
68 - "Blast Immunity" (TF_COND_BLAST_IMMUNE) 					- [Immune to Explosives], and other stuff that uses the damage type [DMG_BLAST].
69 - "Fire Immunity" (TF_COND_FIRE_IMMUNE) 						- [Immune to Fire], and other stuff that uses the damage type [DMG_BURN, DMG_IGNITE].
70 - "Cheat Death" (TF_COND_PREVENT_DEATH) 							- Prevent-death! You'll still take damage, but always survive to at least 1 HP. After that, condition removed. Good luck!
71 - "TFBot Short-Circuit" (TF_COND_MVM_BOT_STUN_RADIOWAVE) 		- TFBot stun! Only for TF2's native bots (sorry, folks) stuns them with a radio-wave particle above their head. No effect on human / steam-acc players (sadly)
72 - "HWN: Super Haste" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_SPEED_BOOST) 			- HWN: Super-Haste boost! Practically maxes out your move, fire, and reload speeds, and also gives infinite jumps because why not!
73 - "HWN: Megaheal" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_QUICK_HEAL) 			- [HWN: Megaheal] can be used as a sorta-generic version of the Medigun Megaheal, though not entirely. It has CRAZY healing, and heals to a full 2x max health in overheal. You'll only need about 3s of this effect to do so from full health. Healing varies, of course.
74 - "HWN: Gigantified" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_GIANT) 					- HWN: Giant makes players 3x as big, forces thirdperson, and sets their max health to 10x! NOTE: Can easily get stuck if used somewhere enclosed, but you should get unstuck after it expires.
75 - "HWN: Smallified" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_TINY) 					- HWN: Mini makes players 3x as small, forces thirdperson, and inflates their head while raising pitch! NOTE: If you'd get stuck somewhere when growing back to full-size, you just automatically killbind. Use this with caution!

77 - "Ghostified" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_GHOST_MODE) 					- Floating-ghost mode! Forces thirdperson, and is supposed to apply a ghost-model, but often fails. While invisible, you can float around w/ gravity. Return to normal from your current position on cond end!
79 - "Damage Dodge" (TF_COND_OBSCURED_SMOKE) 					- [Damage-dodging]! While active, 75% of all damage hits against you fail! Most, but not all. If you're Scout, you also make the Bonk dodging noises when shot. No visual effects, though.
80 - "Parachuting" (TF_COND_PARACHUTE_ACTIVE) 					- [Parachute Slow-Fall] - if added while you're airborne, you fall slower with a HUD icon, until you either touch the ground or the cond expires.
82 - "Bumper Cart" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_KART) 						- Bumper Cars! Makes your class ride an (invisible) bumper cart while active and increases their head size. Only escape is to let the cond run out or to respawn! Beep-beep!
83 - "Bumper Cart Boost" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_KART_DASH) 				- Bumper Boost! This does what it says if you're riding one, but if not, then it raises your FoV smoothly, and also briefly plays the Bumper Car boosting animation w/ sound, if able.
84 - "Balloon Head" (TF_COND_BALLOON_HEAD) 							- BIG HEAD MODE!! Super gigasizes your head, lowers your voice pitch, and makes you fall slightly slower.
85 - "HWN: Mini-Melee" (TF_COND_MELEE_ONLY) 						- [HWN: Minified] for real this time, it adds 75 and 32 so you're tiny AND fast! Also, on its own, this actually properly forces you to melee-only.
86 - "Jarate-Swimming" (TF_COND_SWIMMING_CURSE) 				- [Air-Swimming], sorta. Gain all the effects of swimming, get forced to thirdperson, and get covered in a strange, acrid yellow-liquid! This counts as being wet for those "crit_vs_wet_players" fiends, be careful!!
87 - "Immobilized" (TF_COND_FREEZE_INPUT) 							- Frozen input, you can't move at all, whether it be to shoot, switch weapons, or even turn around. The only thing you can do is taunt. Not terribly fun...

102 - "Cloak: Afterburn Immune" (TF_COND_AFTERBURN_IMMUNE) 		- [Immune to Afterburn], but not regular fire-damage! Decent for if you want to avoid the status effect, like sparingly for Spy...
106 - "Passtime Invuln" (TF_COND_PASSTIME_INTERCEPTION) 		- [Passtime Invuln] basically is a slightly more functional, WAY more disorienting Bonk! effect for all-classes. Apply a dizzying screen-effect, but also speed-blurs and trails, and invulnerability for the duration.
107 - "Air-Floating" (TF_COND_SWIMMING_NO_EFFECTS) 					- Air-Floating, or just swimming but with no effects. No anims, no particles, just floating funnily up and down.
108 - "HWN: Super-Boost" (TF_COND_PURGATORY) 						- HWN: Escaped from Hell does a bunch of weird stuff. On-add, it restores any missing health you had, and flashes 1s of über. Then, on-end, it adds crits, über, speedboost, full overheal, and also displays a chat-message about you escaping from the Underworld!
118 - "Healing Debuff" (TF_COND_HEALING_DEBUFF) 					- Heal-Debuff, heal teammates slower, gain über slower, and some of your übercharges are less effective??
119 - "MfD: Passtime" (TF_COND_PASSTIME_PENALTY_DEBUFF) 			- Passtime-exclusive MfD, for some reason. Supposedly goes away if you're carrying a TF_Weapon_Passtime_Gun with teammates around??
123 - "Gas'd" (TF_COND_GAS) 									- [Gas]-sodden. Yeesh. Covers your screen, and any damage you take will light you on fire and remove this, too!
124 - "Burning: Pyro" (TF_COND_BURNING_PYRO) 					- [Afterburn-for-Pyros]! Doesn't do much by itself, but this lets affected Pyros be lit on fire by other sources, and take afterburn damage like everybody else.
125 - "Jetpack Falling" (TF_COND_ROCKETPACK) 						- Falling with jetpack, doesn't seem to do much other than make a whistling noise if you fall at speed.
126 - "Slippery" (TF_COND_LOST_FOOTING) 							- Ice-physics while moving! ONLY if added while already moving, lowers friction so you go slip-sliding around! Ends when you stop moving, or cond expires.

[LAST UPDATED: TF2C v3.0.3]
[NOTE: Entries here are liable to change as TF2 / TF2C update!]
136 - "Tranquilized" (TF2C_COND_TRANQUILIZED) 					- [Tranq'd]! You know how it works. Slower speed + weapon functions, dulled hearing, colorblinded + team blinded. Knives will crit players with this condition!
137 - "VIP: Haste Buff" (TF2C_COND_CIV_SPEED) 					- [VIP Haste]! Or, something similar to it. Functions similar to Speed Boost, but also makes weapon functions faster! Also plays the Disciplinary Action sounds and spawns speed trail particles.
138 - "Airblasted" (TF2C_COND_AIRBLAST) 							- Airblast helper. Prevents players from moving / strafing toward the origin. Flamethrower gives origin info on airblast, but otherwise, "origin" is literally the map origin... yikes. Try not to use.
139 - "Speed Glow" (TF2C_COND_ANCHOR_FALL_CHARGED) 				- [Speed-Glow], as if you're falling with the Anchor, but nothing else! Pretty similar visually to Bonk Invuln dodging, now that I look at it...
140 - "Launched / Falling" (TF2C_COND_LAUNCHED) 					- Jump Pad / Mantreads falling! Wooshing noise while in the air. If you land on someone, transfer fall damage, etc etc. Usually removed if touching the ground, so might be tricky to use...
141 - "???" (TF2C_COND_JUMPPAD_ASSIST)								- Allegedly related to the Jump Pad?
142 - "???" (TF2C_COND_JUST_USED_JUMPPAD)							- Allegedly related to the Jump Pad?
143 - "VIP: Minicrits" (TF2C_COND_CIV_DAMAGE) 					- [VIP Minicrits]! Just your usual minicrits, but it also applies to your owned Sentries and Medigun healing.
144 - "Self-Launched" (TF2C_COND_LAUNCHED_SELF)						- Self-Knockback helper, used for anything that sends you into the air with "apply_self_knockback".
145 - "VIP: Defensive Buff" (TF2C_COND_CIV_HEAL) 				- [VIP Def. Buff]! Players with the buff take 35% less damage from all sources. Also they get neat visual / audio effects. Technically numbers are changable by cvar, but who changes those???
146 - "Concussed" (TF2C_COND_CONCUSSION) 							- Concussive swaying! Your firstperson screen and crosshair move around unsteadily in an "8" pattern, making it disorienting to shoot or move! Your actual aim and movement is completely unaffected, though now with great difficulty.
147 - "???" (TF2C_COND_MIRV_SLOW)									- Allegedly related to the MIRV?
148 - "Residual Healing" (TF2C_COND_RESIDUAL_HEAL)					- 'Nader / Rejuvenator healing helper. Added when a patient is getting passive healing after being hit with a heal grenade.

//---------------------------------------------------- This is some reference for some of the more obscure "BitFlag" type attributes (as well as some other ones with internal lists or stuff)
//---------------------------------------------------- BitFlags are essentially a way for the game to mix and match combinations of effects using just one input number
//--BitFlag / Unique Attrib Specifics ----------------
//---------------------------------------------------- As a bad example, if you want a bowl of ice-cream, and we have a set of values like [1 - Vanilla, 2 - Chocolate, 4 - Strawberry, 8 - Mint, 16 - Sprinkles],
//---------------------------------------------------- then a value of "25" as an input tells the game you want Vanilla and Mint ice-cream with Sprinkles (1 + 8 + 16)

18 - "medigun charge is crit boost" (set_charge_type)
231 - "medigun charge is megaheal" (set_charge_type)
473 - "medigun charge is resists" (set_charge_type)

//-----//

20 - "crit vs burning players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)
Uses bitflags to figure out what conds to check for crits against, can be added up for multiple crits vs. effects on one weapon (Yikes????)

1 - TF_COND_BURNING (Cond 22; Burning Players)
2 - TF_COND_AIMING (Cond 0; Revved / Scoped)
4 - TF_COND_ZOOMED (Cond 1; Scoped Players)
8 - TF_COND_DISGUISING (Cond 2; Disguised)

//-----//

116 - "mod soldier buff type" (set_buff_type)
Uses an internal list to set what buffs should be used for certain weapons that can use buffs! Not all buffs work on all items.

1 - Banner Minicrits (Applies a minicrit-boost for 35% bonus damage, with buff-rings! Plays a bugle sound and attaches a unique flag, if able. Works on TF_Weapon_Banner, but also TF_Weapon_Flamethrower and TF_Weapon_SniperRifle)
2 - Banner Def. Buff (Applies a 35% defensive boost to incoming damage, with buff-rings! Plays a bugle sound and attaches a unique flag, if able. Works on TF_Weapon_Banner, but also TF_Weapon_Flamethrower and TF_Weapon_SniperRifle)
3 - Banner Lifesteal (Applies a 35% damage-lifesteal effect to damage you do, with buff-rings! Plays a bugle sound and attaches a unique flag, if able. Works on TF_Weapon_Banner, but also TF_Weapon_Flamethrower and TF_Weapon_SniperRifle)
4 - Parachute??? (Attaches a parachute model, if able. Unsure if it does much, buff-wise. Works on TF_Weapon_Parachute, NOT COMPATIBLE with anything else!)
5 - Phlog Crits (Applies a crit-boost, with extra defensive perks on TF_Weapon_Flamethrower. Also works on TF_Weapon_SniperRifle. NOT compatible with the banners, you'll crash!!)
6 - Sniper Focus (Applies a Focus-boost, which keeps you scoped in after firing! Has some fake crit-fx, which works for TF_Weapon_Flamethrower. NOT compatible with the banners, you'll crash!!)

//-----//

119 - "sticky detonate mode" (set_detonate_mode)
127 - "sticky air burst mode" (set_detonate_mode)
Uses an internal list to set what a pill-based grenade projectile will do when fired.

1 - Explode under Cursor (TF_Weapon_PipebombLauncher only! Makes stickybombs only blow up if you're aiming at them)
2 - Shatter on Hit World (Grenades will shatter harmlessly on hitting the world. They'll still explode if they hit a player, or if they detonate via. fuse while midair)

//-----//

134 - "attach particle effect" (set_attached_particle)
370 - "attach particle effect static" (set_attached_particle_static)
2041 - "taunt attach particle index"
Uses a user-defined list (under "attribute_controlled_attached_particles") to attach different particle effects onto a player or their items!
Yes, you can add ANY other particles you want via schema, but I'll list the ones that work by default, and caveats.

1 - burningplayer_red (Full-body fire effect)
2 - burningplayer_flyingbits (Lighter full-body fire effect)
3 - particle_nemesis_burst_blue (BLU Nemesis icon outline, needs an attachment to work)
4 - community_sparkle (Shiny sparkles! APPEARS IN VIEWMODELS BY DEFAULT!! This is the only default particle system that will appear in your viewmodel for weapons!)
5 - halopoint (Halo glow, needs an attachment to work)

Entries 6~90 don't work by default, since they're all a different "type" of particles, in their own sections. Easy fix. Manually moving them to "other_particles" with 1~5 will make them functional. I won't list them out, they're mostly Unusual effects. Since you need to touch 'em anyway, modify them as you wish!
...every entry from 91 onwards (including weapon + taunt unusual fx) also requires you hook the newer particle .pcfs, or they won't visually appear. They'll also work afterward.

//-----//

250 - "air dash count" (air_dash_count)
Uses some sort of system or pattern to determine extra jump or minicrit-dealing status.

-1 - Jump 1 less time (single jump), can deal airborne minicrits
-0.5 - Jump 1 less time
0.5 - Jump +1 more time (triple-jump)
1 - Jump +1 more time, can deal airborne minicrits
2+ - Jump +x more times (as many as you want), can deal airborne minicrits

Values lower or greater than what's listed generally don't have any other effect, you'll always deal minicrits beyond those points.

//-----//

280 - "override projectile type" (override_projectile_type)	
Uses an internal list to set what projectile something turns into!
(Also will list what they respond to, for Modders)

TEMP: BUNCHA STUFF CHANGED HERE, NOTE IT ALL DOWN

3 - Pipe Bomb (Pipe-based w/ physics, can model change. Explodes on impact and after time. Has a working timer particle)
4 - Stickybomb (Physics, can model change. If not on SBL, these are buggy, and won't disappear unless you switch class)
5 - Syringe (Syringe-based)
6 - Flare (Gravity. Can model change. Hits players, fizzles on world. Ignites for a split-second by default)
8 - Arrow (Arrow-based, can headshot) -- BEHAVES WEIRDLY

12 - Cow Mangler Laser -- BEHAVES WEIRDLY
13 - R. Bison Laser

33 - Laser (Rocket-based w/ no grav. Hits players, fizzles on world. Bounces off walls at high speeds. No model by default.)
34 - Dynamite Pack (Pipe-based w/ physics, can model change. Can hit players, explodes after time. Bomblets affected by some pipe modifiers)
35 - TF2C Arrow (Arrow-based, can headshot. Unsure why there's another one, but maybe it has some coding fixes or something.) -- BEHAVES WEIRDLY
36 - EMP Bomb (Pipe-based w/ physics, can model change. All currently active explode when releasing M1)
37 - Heal Grenade (Pipe-based w/ physics, can model change. Explodes on impact and after time. Can heal people by default)
39 - Tranq Dart (Arrow-based. Hits players, sticks to world)

//-----//

3 - MvM Giant Soldier
4 - MvM Giant Demoman
5 - MvM Giant Scout
6 - MvM Giant Pyro
7 - MvM Sentry Buster

Uses an internal list to determine effects to apply to your player sounds.

44 - 10% higher pitched
45 - 10% lower pitched

556 - "taunt attack name" (taunt_attack_name)
Uses an internal list to determine what effect happens while taunting! Below are my findings, sorted since they come in no particular order;
Most of the taunt-effects have tons of hardcoded properties, so if you use them, plan ahead. This includes things like their damage, kill-icon, secondary effects, healing, and more.

Taunt Kills:
TAUNTATK_SCOUT_GRAND_SLAM - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, with crowd cheering sounds and a flying ragdoll to boot!
TAUNTATK_SOLDIER_GRENADE_KILL - Taunt-kill. Deals up to 500 DMG in a radius, and also blows you up in the process! Can cause crashes occasionally, be real careful with this one.
TAUNTATK_PYRO_ARMAGEDDON - Taunt-kill. Deals up to 400 DMG in a radius, decreasing 100 per target hit, and lights them on fire.
TAUNTATK_PYRO_HADOUKEN - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, and lights them on fire.
TAUNTATK_PYRO_GASBLAST - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, and lights them on fire.
TAUNTATK_DEMOMAN_BARBARIAN_SWING - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, and decapitates the enemy.
TAUNTATK_DEMOMAN_MIRV_KILL - Taunt-kill. Deals up to 500 DMG in a radius, and also blows you up in the process! Also throws around MIRV bomblets with the explosion.
TAUNTATK_HEAVY_HIGH_NOON - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG. Long range.
TAUNTATK_ENGINEER_TRICKSHOT - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG. Long range.
TAUNTATK_ENGINEER_GUITAR_SMASH - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, and smashes the ragdoll's head into its neck!

TAUNTATK_MEDIC_UBERSLICE_KILL - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG. Medics also get full Übercharge afterward.
TAUNTATK_MEDIC_UBERSLICE_IMPALE - Taunt-kill. Stuns, deals 1 DMG, then 500 DMG. Timing is static. Medics also get full Übercharge afterward.
-
TAUNTATK_SNIPER_ARROW_STAB_KILL - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, sending the ragdoll backward.
TAUNTATK_SNIPER_ARROW_STAB_IMPALE - Taunt-kill. Stuns an enemy, then deals 500 DMG, sending the ragdoll backward. Timing is static.
-
TAUNTATK_ENGINEER_ARM_KILL - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG, and makes the ragdoll explode!
TAUNTATK_ENGINEER_ARM_BLEND - Taunt-kill. Deals 13 ticks of 1 DMG, then 500 DMG, and makes the ragdoll explode! Timing is static.
TAUNTATK_ENGINEER_ARM_IMPALE - Taunt-kill. Stuns, deals 14 ticks of 1 DMG, then 500 DMG, and makes the ragdoll explode! Timing is static.
-
TAUNTATK_SPY_FENCING_STAB - Taunt-kill. Deals 500 DMG.
TAUNTATK_SPY_FENCING_SLASH_A - Taunt-kill. Deals 2 ticks of 25 DMG, then 500 DMG. Timing is static.
TAUNTATK_SPY_FENCING_SLASH_B - Taunt-kill. Deals 25 DMG, then 500 DMG. Timing is static.

---

Other Weird Taunt Effects...?:
TAUNTATK_PYRO_SCORCHSHOT - Fires your weapon once while taunting! Only seems to work for TF_Weapon_Flaregun. Scorch Shot's flares ("set_weapon_mode" to 3) deal an additional 400 DMG at close range.
TAUNTATK_HEAVY_RADIAL_BUFF - Heals you & nearby allies by 50 HP with particle fx. Also grants 10% critrate boost for a moment, it's barely noticeable.
TAUNTATK_MEDIC_RELEASE_DOVES - Releases a bunch of dove models that fly off from your position!
TAUNTATK_MEDIC_HEROIC_TAUNT - Plays a heavenly choir, creates glowy particles, then releases a bunch of dove models that fly off from your position! Timing is static.
TAUNTATK_MEDIC_INHALE - Heals you by 1 HP. Assumedly, Medic's Kritzkrieg taunt probably just triggers the effect once every frame until a certain time, so it's not useful by itself.
TAUNTATK_ALLCLASS_GUITAR_RIFF - Plays the Shred Alert's guitar sounds and particles. Doesn't appear to do damage.
TAUNTATK_HEAVY_EAT - Doesn't do anything by itself. Used by consumable lunchbox items.
TAUNTATK_SCOUT_DRINK - Doesn't do anything by itself. Used by consumable lunchbox items.

856 - "item_meter_charge_type" (item_meter_charge_type)
Uses an internal list to change how item meters recharge.

[NON-FUNC] 19 - "tmp dmgbuff on hit" (addperc_ondmgdone_tmpbuff)
[NON-FUNC] 23 - "mod flamethrower push" (set_flamethrower_push_disabled) 				- No functionality, use "airblast_disabled" instead. Interestingly, this DOES work in Legacy TF2C, but not here.
[NON-FUNC] 27 - "alt-fire disabled" (unimplemented_altfire_disabled)
[NON-FUNC] 39 - "dmg penalty vs nonstunned" (unimplemented_mod_dmg_vs_nonstunned)
[NON-FUNC] 40 - "zoom speed mod disabled" (unimplemented_mod_zoom_speed_disabled)		- Speed boost while scoped. Can be sorta-replicated by changing "mult_player_aiming_movespeed" to a higher value. Revved Miniguns and Scoped Rifles count as "aiming". Max speed is normal walking speed this way, though!
[NON-FUNC] 47 - "sniper no charge" (unimplemented_mod_sniper_no_charge)					- Was previously functional in Legacy TF2C, but non-func here.
[NON-FUNC] 50 - "absorb damage while cloaked" (unimplemented_absorb_dmg_while_cloaked)

[NON-FUNC] 152 - "custom texture lo" (custom_texture_lo)								- This probably requires a connection to Steam item-servers directly. Doubt it could ever work in TF2C, sadly.

[NON-FUNC] 172 - "purchased" (purchased)
[NON-FUNC] 184 - "duel loser account id" (duel_loser_account_id)

[NON-FUNC] 186 - "gifter account id" (gifter_account_id)
[NON-FUNC] 188 - "preserve ubercharge" (preserve_ubercharge)							- Theoretically, this SHOULD work, but Valve most likely completely scrubbed the code for this in favor of the newer Vita-Saw rework. The unconditional variant doesn't appear to work.
[NON-FUNC] 189 - "elevate quality" (set_elevated_quality)								- This appears like it'd be used on item-system items to change the rarity of one item using another item.
[NON-FUNC] 192 - "referenced item id low" (referenced_item_id_low)
[NON-FUNC] 193 - "referenced item id high" (referenced_item_id_high)

[NON-FUNC] 265 - "mod mini-crit airborne deploy" (mini_crit_airborne_deploy)
[NON-FUNC] 268 - "mult sniper charge penalty DISPLAY ONLY" (mult_sniper_charge_base_dummy) - It DOES say it's display-only.

[NON-FUNC] 415 - "counts as assister is some kind of pet this update is going to be awesome" (counts_as_assister)	- This MIGHT work, but I haven't had much success getting it to so far. More than likely it's broken.
[NON-FUNC] 439 - "override item level desc string" (override_item_level_desc_string)
[NON-FUNC] 446 - "halloweenvision opt in DISPLAY ONLY" (halloweenvision_opt_in_display_only)

[NON-FUNC] 468 - "strange score selector" (strange_score_selector)
[NON-FUNC] 471 - "engineer rage on dmg" (generate_rage_on_dmg)							- This seems like it'd do something, but I can't get any sort of meter to appear on TF_Weapon_Shotgun_Building_Rescue
[NON-FUNC] 494 - "kill eater 3" (kill_eater_3)
[NON-FUNC] 495 - "kill eater score type 3" (kill_eater_score_type_3)

[NON-FUNC] 501 - "custom desc attr" (custom_desc_attr)
[NON-FUNC] 512 - "throwable fire speed" (throwable_fire_speed)							- I'm not entirely sure what these are for, but I assume they're the SF13 halloween spells. The MIRV uses the normal attributes, so ignore these.

[NON-FUNC] 514 - "throwable healing" (throwable_healing)
[NON-FUNC] 515 - "throwable particle trail only" (throwable_particle_trail_only)
[NON-FUNC] 528 - "decoded by itemdefindex" (decoded_by_itemdefindex)					- Used by Crates to define what items open them.
[NON-FUNC] 539 - "set throwable type" (set_throwable_type)								- MIGHT be used by Halloween Spells, but I don't really wanna check
[NON-FUNC] 540 - "add head on hit" (add_head_on_hit)									- I think this is supposed to add a kill for weapons that track it, like the Eyelander or H. Heatmaker...? It doesn't work, at least for the attacker. Maybe it steals heads?
[NON-FUNC] 542 - "item style override" (item_style_override)							- This might work, but since we're going in and editing this stuff by hand anyway, it's not worth checking.

[NON-FUNC] 544 - "show paint description" (show_paint_description)

[NON-FUNC] 612 - "rocket launch impulse" (mod_rocket_launch_impulse)

[NON-FUNC] 633 - "projectile particle name" (projectile_particle_name)					- Appears to be nonfunctional... seems like this was for the Airstrike's rocket, before they decided to hard-code it like usual.
[NON-FUNC] 634 - "air jump on attack" (air_jump_on_attack)
[NON-FUNC] 645 - "breadgloves properties" (breadgloves_properties)

[NON-FUNC] 719 - "weapon_uses_stattrak_module" (weapon_uses_stattrak_module)			- Stattrak module attachments appear to be removed. I think there's other ways to add an attached model if you really wanted to have them back, anyway.

[NON-FUNC] 1004 - "SPELL: set item tint RGB" (set_item_tint_rgb_override)				- HALLOWEEN ONLY: Paints your paintable-item a certain color that also pulsates! Theoretically, this might be usable, but it's a paint, so hard to say if it'd even do anything or not.
